Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big wine, clearly in need of cellaring. There's a massive core of blackberries, cherries and baking chocolate on the palate, but it's rigidly tannic, dry and acidic still.

Give it until 2017 to begin to mellow, and it could still be going strong in 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An interesting percentage of Cabernet Franc gives this wine a more perfumed character than is usual in many Pomerols.

A luxuriously velvety texture is the standout, though, supported by great structure and length.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lifted notes of honey and rose petal play on the nose, the palate is altogether more lively than the nose suggests: sprightly and fresh, concentrated and caramel-tinged with lemon freshness. This strikes an appetizing, moreish palate and makes for joyful drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Creamy in texture and floral in aroma, this is a lovely and well-integrated white wine, with well-crafted characteristics of pear and honeyed apple. Medium bodied, it'll pair well at the table and on its own.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo.

The extracted palate delivers mature black currant, dried blackberry, espresso and black pepper alongside dusty tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine pushes the notion of low alcohol, giving soft and subtle an extreme definition. As such, it will not please everyone. Earthy spice and an exotic notion of orange blossom dance around a light, clear body and high-toned minerality. It hails from a foggy, shaded vineyard in Freestone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of underbrush, leather, berry and a balsamic note. The forward palate offers dried cherry, white pepper, tobacco and the warmth of alcohol alongside firm tannins. Drink this sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Always released after a further year's aging, this rich and full-bodied wine is now at its peak.

It abruptly ends on a green note of powdered sage.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Roasted coffee bean and menthol aromas lead the nose while the evolved palate offers dark bitter chocolate, licorice and a toasted note. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit has largely dried up while astringent tannins lead to a bracing finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The sweet scent of raspberry and strawberry preserves waft from this Cab Franc icewine from Casa Larga. On the palate as well, there's a nice concentration of preserved berry flavors that soar on the palate with a bright, sunny acidity. Finishes clean and long with just a hint of autumn leaves and bramble.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A big burly Syrah from this Temecula producer whose goal it is to become the premier winery of Southern California, the wine is loaded with plummy black fruit and a peppery mouthfeel, its oakiness derived from the almost three years it spent barrel-aging in new French oak. Not for the meek at 15.6% alcohol, it finishes a tad sweet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thanks to eight years in Vin Santo's traditional caratelli barrels, this sweet blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia offers a dark, golden-amber color, bearing intense aromas of dried apricot, candied fruit, honey and toasted almond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Syrah grown on its property across multiple vintages, and then cave-aged six years in American oak, this is a nice dessert wine, raisiny and brimming in Christmas spice. With plenty of body and acidity, it swims effortlessly and smoothly on the palate, a bite of decadence that will work well with rich cheeses.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Roasted coffee bean, underbrush, toast and allspice lead the nose on this big wine. The one-dimensional palate offers dense cherry extract, licorice and the warmth of alcohol. It's already evolved so drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend from most parts of the village, with fruit from 14 different parcels.

Drink from 2018\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Young vines, planted in 2007, give a fresh, fruity wine with attractive citrus and zingy orange flavors. It is ripe and deliciously perfumed with a touch of minerality and saltiness. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged a little more than two years in 90% new French oak and then in bottle, time has been kind to this wine, a Syrah of dark mushroom and baked blackberry, that's savory and silky with a slight hint of mint on the finish. Mighty and impressive.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of leather, vineyard dust, dried violet and a whiff of pressed powder lead the nose. The simple palate isn't very expressive, showing sour red cherry and a hint of baking spice alongside close-grained tannins that dry out the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has aromas suggesting grilled herb, toasted oak, espresso and a whiff of wet animal fur. The palate offers dried cherry, game, anisette and a green note of bitter sage alongside extremely astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toasted oak, roasted coffee bean and a whiff of sawdust. The bracing palate offers dried cherry, espresso and mocha alongside astringent tannins.

The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, star anise and a hint of orange zest while assertive, tightly knit tannins leave an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers scents and flavors that recall stewed prune, raisin and black pepper. It's still tight, with aggressive tannins that leave a firm clenching finish.

Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky, with bursts of sage and celery root, this is a wine that is unabashedly earthy, spicy, bold and juicy at its core. Light-bodied and delicate, the palate shows beautiful floral undertones. This is a complex and beguiling bottling that should hold well for years to come.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill.

On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite the problematic vintage, this wine opens with bold aromatic intensity, featuring notes of prune, plum, blackberry and spice.

Williams Selyem's last few vintages of Precious Mountain have been extraordinary, but this 2009 tops them all. The wine is as light as a feather in the mouth, modest in alcohol and delicately feminine, like pure satin. However, few Pinot Noirs in the world achieve this level of concentration. Wild raspberries and cherries, cola, sleek minerals, dusty baking spices and smoky oak combine for flavors that are utterly delicious.

As so often, Lynch-Bages is a blockbuster, dark and concentrated, with immense aging potential.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The purest Cabernet Sauvignon fruit, with dark chocolate and intense dark berry flavors.

Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: One of the peculiarities of St.-\\u00c3\\u0089milion's classification is that Canon la Gaffeli\\u00c3\\u00a8re is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This stylish Merlot-based wine has juicy red-berry flavors that are sustained by acidity and firmed up by tannins.

A best blend of vineyards available to the winery, this Cab was aged in 100% new French oak. The alcohol level is high, leading to questions of ageability.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The fruit appears very ripe, almost too ripe, making the wine difficult to pair with food because of the width and intensity of its jammy nose. Yet more harmonious tones of chocolate, coffee and spice kick in at the rear to add dimension.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As much as Tuscany and Syrah seem to be a match made in heaven, this wine is lower in overall intensity and rather neutral in aromas. Pretty cherry-berry and fine wood nuances are measured and understated. Firm structure and tannins, with a tart cherry note on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The packaging is totally crazy but the wine is more subdued. A blend of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet, it delivers raw strawberry, green leaf notes and loads of dried hay. It has a sharp, solid build and rigid tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, pressed powder, violet and wild berry mingle in the glass.

Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied red manages to be concentrated and weightless at the same time. It opens with aromas of blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of espresso.

It's impeccably balanced, with velvety tannins and just the right amount of freshness. Drink through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Classically crafted, it opens with a fruit-driven fragrance of bright red berries accented with whiffs of cooking spices and balsamic herbs.

Soft and delicious, this is already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe.

Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from certified organic grapes, this wine is both savory and tannic, a tad muted on the nose and wanting in texture. Cassis and pipe tobacco stand out most.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Fresh blackberry fruits give a smooth wine, rich and with an immediately attractive fresh acidity. It does have the density of fruit along with relatively soft tannins. At the back there is a more chocolate character.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine continues the upward progression of Clerc-Milon. It has weight and density while also showing sweetness and delicious acidity. A very complete wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: So soft and sweet, it's like a melted dessert pastry.

The tannins are soft enough to drink this 100% Cabernet now, and it is probably best enjoyed over the next six years before it loses freshness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tinata is a sultry blend of Syrah and Grenache, a Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne-style blend unlike any other wine in the area. These grapes seem perfectly adapted to the little-known region of Capalbio in the southern part of Tuscany and deliver intense aromas of blackberry, leather, chocolate and cured meat. It's plush, rich and extremely long-lasting.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Siepi is a gorgeous 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that delivers intense aromas of ripe black fruit, rum cake, leather, moist tobacco and Indian spice.

It has concentration and an opaque texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This massive super Tuscan blend based mostly on Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon is thick, inky dark in color and particularly intense this vintage. Black cherry, spice, plum cake and leather are protagonists of the bouquet. The mouthfeel is smooth and incredibly rich.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hendry has a good track record with Cabernet, and although this isn't their best effort, it's an interesting, moderately ageworthy wine. It's pretty tough in tannins right now, but the astringency frames ripe blackberry and cassis flavors that linger in the finish. Needs time.

The palate has fresh strawberry, coffee and citrusy notes but not much depth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a bit of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec, this Cab is marked by hard tannins and blackberry and cherry jam, black currant and oak flavors.

Decant and drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Barolo Gramolere offers an attractive window onto the Nebbiolo grape with peek views at its inherent complexity and elegance.

Licorice notes and a final blast of char control the finish. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich mix of red, blue and black fruit opens into a sappy, spicy midpalate. The lush fruits are highlighted by a wash of milk chocolate. At first tightly wound, the wine seems to show more oak flavors with air, hinting at licorice and Bourbon barrel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Just beautiful, this is the best Sterling Reserve Cabernet in years, and a huge improvement over the 2008.

Juicy, zesty and jagged feeling at the moment, this should be consumed no earlier than 2014 and may be at its best around 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very opulent and jammy in blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, this has a strong oak presence in the form of caramelized wood. It defines Napa richness, but it is too tannic and immature to properly enjoy now.

It's an exotic wine, spicy and peppery, almost briary, like a Zinfandel, except with flavors of wild forest raspberries, cherries, orange zest and a hint of pine cone. It's as cellarable a Pinot Noir as exists in California. Best after 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Structured, concentrated, a wine that shows power from both fruit and tannins.

This is a firmly tannic wine, needing aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Beautiful lemon-scented wine, balancing rich butter and apricot flavors with intense, pure acidity. The wine at this stage is toast and fruit, still coalescing into its long-term future.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the wood flavors on the palate. However, it's the powerful sweet black cherry and red berry fruit flavors, layered with fruit tannins and acidity, that are driving this impressive wine.

An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage the wine is comprised of Malbec, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. It's a deeper, darker, richer wine than the '07, with which it was co-released, and equally high-scoring.

It imparts a very smooth, rich and supple feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is mostly Grenache, with about one-third Syrah blended in.

Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is fruity as a pastry, with flavors of nougat, blackberry and cherry jam, toasted almond and honey.

It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Horsey, leathery aromas are earthy and funky, although with time blackberry notes rise up.

Give it time, although it is probably always going to be dry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe black currant, grilled pepper and cured meat lead the nose.

It does need aging, so drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied wine offers classic Nebbiolo aromas of underbrush, black cherry, leather and a whiff of baking spices. It's still young, delivering raspberry, clove, cinnamon and grilled herb framed by tightly woven tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink after 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose on this dense wine opens with aromas of roasted coffee bean and toasted sensations. The concentrated palate offers espresso, chocolate, mature plum and vanilla alongside an infusion of brooding tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, espresso and toasted oak carry over to the palate along with raw red berry. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent tannins and racy acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An unusual medley of aromas include orange peel, dill, mint, thyme, espresso and oak. The palate offers coffee, toasted oak and sugary vanilla but it doesn't have much fruit richness. Astringent tannins give a short, bitter finish that dries out the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Softened by 10% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, this is a medium-bodied, elegant wine, with highlights of coffee, cedar and cherry-vanilla. Classic elements of cedar and dried herb complement firm, solid tannin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The producer sources from three sites, each vineyard-designate worthy: Cleary Ranch and Rayhill Vineyard in Freestone, and Stiling Vineyard in Russian River Valley. Together they sing, coaxing spicy white pepper and clove from the grapes while a velvety texture of firm tannin provides support. Raspberry and baked cherry highlight the fruit flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Petit Verdot and 20% Cabernet Franc, this has inviting aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, forest floor and a whiff of cedar. The dense, polished palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove, licorice and tobacco. Firm, refined tannins provide support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The producer sources primarily from its historic Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard for this wine, a rich expression of the variety opaque in color. Meat, black pepper, leather and tobacco give it a velvety lushness and concentration buoyed by complex, savory components. The lengthy finish is all about bittersweet chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very modern style of wine, with generous new wood and super-ripe fruit flavors, balancing with polished solid tannins. Very international in style, it is good, but could come from anywhere.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This was the last vintage at Clos Fourtet under the ownership of the Lurtons. They made fine wine, but the potential of the property was never quite realized. The wine just fails to excite: it is rich and concentrated with ripe tannins and some sweetness, but at the same time, there is a layer of acidity and structure which gives the wine a firm, solid shape.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the winery's best Cabernet Sauvignon in years. It has classic black currant flavor, enhanced by smoky oak, and feels distinguished in the mouth. It's young, but should begin to mellow and show its stuff by 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A little ungainly now, with stiff tannins and lots of fresh, jammy raspberry and cherry fruit colliding with unintegrated oak notes. All the parts are there, but they need until 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020 to meld.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite the challenging harvest, this Cabernet excels in juicy blueberry and plum tones. Dusted with cinnamon on the finish, it shows a level-headed use of oak, imparting a soft, expressive texture marked by acidity. Enjoy now or cellar through 2026.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Still young and firm, this wine gives indications of potential fruitiness along with a structure that promises concentration. Layers of black fruits and acidity need time to integrate fully with the dark structure and dense texture. Wait to drink this wine for a few more years, at least until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a selection of vineyard sites and clones, this wine offers juicy acidity behind a wave of plummy red and black cherry, an earthy foundation keeping things real. Oak and tannins are well integrated, and plenty of clove flavor make for a spicy finish. This gets extra attention for the awesome label.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This beautifully perfumed wine comes from one of the highest in elevation premier cru vineyards. The tannins have fully integrated with the red berry and cherry fruits to give a soft, jammy character that contrasts with acidity to give a great lift at the end. Drink this sophisticated wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, cured meat, grilled herb, menthol and dark-skinned fruit aromas unfold in the glass. The chewy palate offers dried black berry, black cherry, licorice, coffee and toasted nut alongside tightly packed tannins.

Behind this generous front, the wine is tight, steely and needs to age.

Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The two parcels that go into this wine have performed well in 2012. This solid, dense wine is firm with tannins and rich with red plum and berry fruits. It is perfumed, ripe and concentrated. With this structure and with the acidity, it will age, so drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Exotic, complex and vivid aromas, rich and fulfilling fruit flavors and a hefty structure form a great package in this full-bodied and extroverted wine. The winemaker allowed wild yeast and kept 30% whole clusters in the fermentation, then aged it in neutral barrels.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied Viognier opens with aromas of toasted oak, butterscotch, vanilla and mature apricot. On the richly textured palate, notes of vanilla, nut and toast precede creamy white peach and lemon drop.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas recall spicy plum and black raspberry. The concentrated but balanced palate offers cassis, prune and blackberry, with velvety tannins and fresh acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The main taste impression of this superripe Cabernet is of chocolate-covered raisins. Then the even riper notes of prunes emerge. The alcohol, which is 15.7% by volume, gives the finish a glyceriney sweetness. It will satisfy die-hard fans of this Napa style, but it's hard to see this clumsy wine developing in the bottle before the fruit crashes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: French oak, a whiff of exotic spice and a buttery note lead the nose. The oak-driven aromas follow through to the tannic palate together with licorice, roasted coffee bean and dried cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A joint offering from winemakers Mitch Cosentino and Paul Scotto, this is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Merlot and 12% Cabernet Sauvignon, all grown in the Oak Knoll District. Softly textured, it's a nicely put-together commingling of black pepper, clove and blackberry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A touch of dried apple skin and cinnamon stick open the nose of this hearty, red dessert wine. It presents tight tannins, with a sweet, chewy chocolate aftertaste.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a caramel candy or custard-like quality to this wine that is backed by pear, apricot and mature fruit. It's a complex, layered sparkler with creamy vanilla mousse and golden saturation.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Structured and elegant, it opens with a fruit fragrance of black plum, wild berries and prune accentuated with hints of leather, tilled soil and spice. The juicy palate delivers wild cherry layered with cinnamon, white pepper and carob alongside big, velvety tannins. Delicious now, it will also develop complexity. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromatic with crushed rock, raspberry, cranberry and hints of clove, this well-structured wine\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009453% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 21% Cabernet Franc and 10% Petit Verdot\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094will reward additional bottle age. The young, tart red fruits are steely and precise, the barrel influence perfectly balanced against the natural acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vintage was a good one for Sequum, which is assembling an impressive track record. The wine is dry and tannic, yet wonderfully forward in blackberries and black currants, and the oak application is perfect. Give it until 2020 or so in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The four soils designation refers to the wine's origins in different vineyards throughout the valley. A great followup to the marvelous 2009, the wine showcases artful blending. It's incredibly rich and ripe in black currants, cassis liqueur and smoky oak, yet balanced in acids and tannins. Drink now and through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This dynamite Tempranillo hails from a top producer and a top vintage. Aromas of toasty oak, graphite, coffee and blackberry feed into a rugged but generous palate fueled by firm tannins. Dark, toasty flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate finish long, with mild heat and menthol notes that suggest aging is appropriate. Drink from 2015 through 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Even at more than four years of age, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot remains huge in primary cherry, blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors. The tough, astringent tannins make it essentially undrinkable now. Yet its underling wholesomeness and balance guarantee development through 2021, and possibly longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: plush wine, it's made from 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot. It starts off with aromas of black berries, plum and stewed prunes along with a whiff of cedar. The warm, low-acid palate delivers mature black cherry, black currants, tobacco and black pepper alongside big, ripe tannins and the warmth of the noticeable alcohol. Drink through 2020. Lyra Wine, The Shepherd Company.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Bright cherry and blue floral aromas come with hints of leather and spice.

This structured white wine offers the richness of texture and aromatic intensity to pair with the best of that culinary tradition.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Amarone La Coeta opens with huge oak tones of spice and campfire that will definitely need a few more years of cellar aging before they soften. But this wood-heavy formula does work, given the hearty, thick nature of the wine itself.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: New wood overwhelms the aromas, and it also dominates the palate of this wine. It just keeps on the right side of drinkability because the spice merges into pear flavors to give an intriguing nutmeg character, while the aftertaste offers freshness. The wine needs at least a year to blend together.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ripe, sweet and stylish, with blackberry, root beer and herb aromas. Bulky yet balanced, with black cherry fruit that comes at you in jammy style. Black tea, ground spices, coffee and raw oak work the finish. A dark and handsome wine, but one that isn't overly complex and is ready to drink now through 2011.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Spicy and supple, this has aromas of cured meat, white pepper, toast and dark plum that follow the warm robust palate along with dried black cherry, coffee and licorice.

A lush, full-bodied complement of baked plum and cherry ride out a lengthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this bold wine opens with aromas of black currant, cedar and exotic spice. The concentrated palate delivers blueberry jam, graphite, anise and clove alongside assertive tannins that leave a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of black currant and a whiff of bell pepper slowly emerge on this hearty blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. Concentrated and robust, the palate offers cassis, black cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside big velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A hearty Brunello, it opens with aromas that recall meat juices, leather, mature black fruit cooking spices and turned earth.

It's velvety soft and already accessible so enjoy soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the best vintages in the last 15 years, this classic Barolo needs to be opened a couple of hours ahead of time to breathe. It's a bit shy on aromas but the palate delivers dried cherry, fig, tobacco, white pepper and black tea flavors. Youthful acidity accompanies silky tannins in this wine that is just starting to develop complexity. Drink through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Round and velvety, it has aromas of ripe berry, chocolate and exotic spices. The rich palate delivers juicy black cherry punctuated with ground black pepper, cinnamon, carob, pipe tobacco and mint. Forward and sweet, this is already extremely accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Syrah, this concentrated wine delivers plum, black pepper, cocoa, coffee, fleshy black cherry and notes of bay leaf. It's plush, soft and savory but it also seems shy on vibrancy and essential energy. Drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This offers aromas of wild berry, baking spice, toast and a floral note. On the firm palate, notes of vanilla, clove and powdered sage accent a sour cherry core alongside nervous acidity. Close-grained tannins grip the finish. Drink 2018 through 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Set close to the sea (you can throw a stone into the water), this vineyard produces a fresh, almost salty wine, with a tight tang of citrus. It is perfumed, hinting at raspberries and pears. The aftertaste delivers a delicious, straight line of acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Three barrels were made of this structured, tannic wine that offers a juicy balance between acidity and dark tannins. It is perfumed with acidity that cuts through the red berry and dry concentration. It is a dense wine, full of fruit. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ah, the beautiful fruit aromas, polished texture, ripe but tangy flavors and supreme balance make this an elegant and delicious wine. This is not showy, but slightly reserved, as very little spicy oak is showing through, yet the wine's vibrance and purity keep begging for another sip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spiced plum, crushed blue flower, black currant and a whiff of warms spice waft out of the glass. The high-toned palate delivers ripe blackberry, date and dried cherry accented with notes of nutmeg, licorice and black pepper. Velvety tannins provide structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crushed violet, cake spice and ripe black plum aromas lead the nose on this bold wine. The round, full-bodied palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry jam, cinnamon, licorice and a hint of tobacco alongside ripe, velvety tannins that lend it a polished feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bold and ripe, this offers aromas of crushed blue flower, ripe plum, mocha and exotic spice. The opulent, firmly structured palate doles out black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice, oak and a hint of coconut alongside tightly knit, fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of crushed violet, baked plum, cake spice, ripe berry and tobacco pervade in this bold, full-bodied red. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, fig, mocha, nutmeg, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an oddly perfumed and puckering wine, with not much to say in the way of fruit, the oak treatment suggestive of oak chips.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied red opens with aromas suggesting French oak, raspberry jam coconut and exotic spice. The densely concentrated assertive palate offers licorice, dried cherry, tart cranberry and powdered sage while astringent grainy tannins provide an austere framework.

The wine, of course, is still very young, but shows its future as being rounded and opulent. The acidity that holds it all together shows in the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a powerhouse of a wine, from a tremendous coastal site, situated within a blanket of forest at 1,200-feet elevation. Reductive notes of diesel oak give way to juicy, stemmy and grippy characteristics, marked most pronounced by flavors of black cherry, raspberry and black tea.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: All varietal, this offers aromas of coffee, cherry, chocolate, oak spices and green herbs that show a touch of underripeness. The palate displays elegance, restraint and polish along with a tart finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of baked plum, coconut, scorched earth and oak emerge in the glass.

The palate is all about texture, with good acidity and grip containing the purple fruit flavors\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The producer's proprietary red Bordeaux-inspired blend is austere in this vintage, offering herbal thyme and cedar along with a sharp element of pencil lead.

Ripe orange and lemon go with the honey to give a fine wine that could be drunk now, although that would be a shame. It would be much better to wait until 2017. With just over 200 acres of vines, Quarts de Chaume is a tiny enclave in the Layon Valley.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with earthy aromas of ripe dark fruit, scorched earth, game and truffle.

The linear palate offers cranberry, star anise, espresso and clove flavors, with a backbone of vibrant acidity. Tightly wound tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Leonetti's 2010 Reserve includes 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Malbec\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a more complex blend than the 2009.

It's a big, tannic wine, beautifully crafted, and clearly differentiated from the winery's regular Cabernet bottling.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities.

It's softly tannic and frankly delicious, with dazzlingly rich blackberry, cassis liqueur, anise and mineral flavors. Hard to describe how attractive this wine is now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A delicately structured, low-alcohol Pinot from the Sonoma Coast that shows winemaker Ehren Jordan's increasing fascination with this part of Sonoma County.

The most interesting aspect, however, is the mouthfeel that shows firm but beautifully ripe tannins that will help the wine age 10 years or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Toro wine is a mindblower. The nose is exemplary: it bursts with smooth, rooty aromas of licorice, kirsch and roasted black plum.

It has weight, the firmest of tannins and an immense sense of structure. This neighbor of Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau P\\u00c3\\u00a9trus is firmly dense, showing both the fruits and the tannins in balance. Give this wine at least 10 years in the cellar.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big and smoky wine that's very concentrated. It shows both the power and the structure of the vintage, as well as balances fresh, fragrant fruit. Dry tannins and the dusty texture are finely integrated into a wine that layers wood, intense acidity and great long-term potential.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Austere and severe, this single-vineyard wine is very much a product of its limestone terroir. It has a mineral intensity that pushes through the tannins and black currant fruit, giving a powerful, dark character. Firm and structured, this is a wine for the long term.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak. In the mouth, it's pure Cabernet pleasure, with soft, compelling tannins and fine acidity. It's a dramatic wine that should develop well over the next 10 years, if not longer. This is a winery to watch.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a beautiful interpretation from the 2008 vintage that shows balance, harmony and intensity all zipped up into one tight package. That seamless integration, followed by rich extraction, gives the wine momentum overall. Although this is a different wine from past vintages, the quality is just as high. Hold 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Beautifully aged, this shows a dusty, ripe quality. The bouquet is rounded out by notes of leather, resin, molasses, tobacco, dried ginger, cola and licorice. There's a tight firmness to the tannins, which have gracefully carried this wine forward over the years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With that extra concentration that comes from low-yielding old vines, this has great depth of flavor. It has an apple flavor and crisp, citrusy acidity as well as a more toasty character. Complex and certainly ageworthy, this should keep for at least five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sourced from a small vineyard in the The Rocks of Walla Walla, this shows classic, terroir-driven umami flavors. It's as if the fruit were soaked in seaweed, then lifted on a platform of rock. It has lovely aromatics, with a rather delicate finish that's nuanced with cherry and tar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is big in fruit, big in tannins and big in the overall impression it leaves. It's enormously rich and ripe in cherry, red currant and cola, sprinkled with dusty exotic spice and a hint of forest herb. The vineyard is the former Maritime Vineyard of the W.H. Smith Winery, whose Pinot Noirs were magnificent and scored highly. This one seems a little heavier than Smith used to produce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deliciously perfumed, this shows some of the structure of the vintage, along with generous raspberry and red cherry flavors. It is rich and solid, and its open character has just the right edge of dense tannins. Already approachable, but it's likely to age over several years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firm, concentrated and solid, this has a tight core that's surrounded by sweeter dark-plum fruit. This is ripe and full bodied, with a definite need for aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and bold, this has noticeable alcohol and loads of chocolate, espresso and jammy black-fruit flavors. The overall muscle and brawn of the mouthfeel give balance to the heat and intensity. Pair this with aged cheese or grilled steak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is very structured and full, with a powerful minerality, citrus and spice flavors, and a tight, nervy character. It has the weight to age for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This doles out multiple layers of cinnamon, red cherry, vanilla, blackberry, espresso and tobacco flavors. It's modern, chewy and bright, with slightly sweet flavors that would pair with pork and roasted fennel or steak with a creamy mushroom sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and fruity, this is very lively, balancing butteriness with green-fruit acidity. The wine is maturing quickly, its tension is fading into rich, wood-flavored fruitiness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Powerful and muscular, this would pair with succulent red meat or piquant cheese. The mouthfeel is velvety and supple, and the bouquet is redolent of cooked berry, prune, dried bay leaf, humus, toasted coffee bean and licorice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of mainly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other traditional Bordeaux varieties, this treads perilously close to being too ripe. It shows a hint of raisin, but not enough to interfere with the beauty of the blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors. The tannins are exquisite, in the way of a top Napa Cab. Doesn't seem to be a longterm ager, so drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is powerful, typical of Les Preuses. White and yellow fruits are important to the palate, but so are rich, honeyed toast, minerality and an opulent, intense concentration. This is impressive, elegance with power, and worth aging for several years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Greg La Follette, who made this wine, understands the Van der Kamp vineyard, where this wine comes from, better than anyone. It's a startling wine, rich and full-bodied, yet utterly delicious in youthful appeal. With a fine, dry structure, it offers enormous flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants, mocha, cinnamon and smoky oak, and the finish lasts for a full minute. Expensive, but all the proceeds are for charity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rare venture by Olivier Leflaive outside his home territory around Puligny, Chassagne and Meursault. The wine is classic Corton-Charlemagne, big and bold, a broad-shouldered wine that brings together toastiness, ripe pineapple and mango and balancing, lively acidity. It is already giving great pleasure, but should last well over the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sumptuous and rich, a fully gorgeous Chardonnay, with butter and citrus flavors combining with panache. The wine just fill the mouth, a succession of pineapple, soft toast, spice and mango flavors, finished with acidity. To drink now, but it is worth keeping for 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A rich, mouthfilling,  sophisticated wine. The secret is in the balance, with the concentrated fruit flavors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094dried apricot, mango and lemon\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094in just the right proportion. It tastes delicious now, but will certainly age over five years or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A beautiful, ripe wine that shows the richness of 2006 in Chablis. The wine revels in its yellow fruit flavors, apricots, peaches even pineapple, underscored by new wood flavors. Then acidity comes through, a fresh lift that leaves the wine with a clean, smooth finish. And once these initial fruits soften, the secondary flavors promise some good aging. Screwcap.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A superb wine. It opens slowly in the mouth, revealing layers of toast followed by intense white and green fruits. Spice and nutmeg accent the kiwi, pepper and pineapple notes, all concentrated around a core of minerality. Age for at least four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 100% Cab, this wine pours inky black, and feels softly ripe in the mouth, with pie-filling blackberries, cherries, mocha, plums, tobacco and sweet dusty spices. Shows a tannic astringency that strongly suggests cellaring, although it's flashy now. Best after 2011 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through. Give this high quality wine until the summer of 2009.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This steely, mineral, structured wine speaks of the chalk soil of Puligny. It is firm and crisp, even though the fruit is rich. The wine layers the white fruits and mandarin orange zest with some judicious toast from the wood, leaving spice and ripe acidity on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A brisk, sturdy Cabernet, marked by firm tannins, tart acidity and a marked coating of sweet, smoky oak. It's Janzen's basic Napa Cabernet, and shows the winery's ability to produce elegant Cabs. But it's not an ager.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Beautifully perfumed wine, with fresh red fruits and some fine tannins. The wood element is perhaps too dominant for the weight of the wine. Hopefully this will subside. Give it 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A fine, fruity but structured wine. It brings together many attractive elements of crisp fruits, ripe peaches, toast and a definite tight structure for aging. Keep for 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Surprisingly bright for the vintage and displaying Gaja's trademark elegance, this offers aromas of blue flower, perfumed berry, cake spices and a whiff of leather. The ripe palate delivers mature black cherry layered with white pepper and cinnamon alongside supple tannins. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Balsamic aromas of menthol and eucalyptus unfold in the glass and mingle with scents of leather, licorice and dark berry. The concentrated palate delivers dried black cherry, crushed raspberry, black pepper and grilled herb alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Beautifully balanced, this conveys both rich fruit and a tense, intense minerality. Combining the two strands impeccably, it brings out tangy apple and pink grapefruit flavors and a steely, tight acidity. It's a structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From a seven-acre section of the vineyard, this offers plenty of saddle leather and cedar amidst spicy cardamom layers, a soft, juicy core and tingling acidity. The structure and weight suggest the ability to cellar comfortably through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a classic Nebbiolo fragrance of red rose, leather, perfumed wild berries, forest floor and a hint of menthol. On the palate, white pepper, mint, thyme and eucalyptus notes add depth to the mouthwatering wild cherry and ripe raspberry flavors. It's still young, with a firm, tannic backbone balanced with just enough fresh acidity. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The winery's proprietary block of Zin grapes (planted in 1999) from the coveted Stagecoach Vineyards contributes to an intense wine. Juicy and oaky, it's dense in cherry and plum, a note of lavender and sage complementing the whole. A thick liqueur sense characterizes the texture, but the palate stays alive through the site's rocky minerality. This one'll age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and delicious, this starts off with aromas of fresh violet, rose, perfumed berry, exotic spice and tilled earth. It's still young but the palate already delivers a great depth of flavors including juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, clove and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2016 to 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature black fruit, tobacco, allspice and mocha unfold in the glass along with a note of tilled earth. The opulent palate offers blackberry extract, dried plum, licorice and chocolate while velvety tannins provide support and give it a smooth texture. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense mint, menthol, ripe berry and dark spice aromas lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry mature raspberry, mint, thyme and clove alongside bracing tannins. Give this a few more years to reach its full potential. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Exhibiting cooler-climate characteristics, the fruit sourced primarily from the Stag's Leap District, this wine shows dried herb and cedar on the nose, evolving deeper layers of red cherry and cranberry on the midpalate. It takes on weight and structure on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A ripe, red berry-fruit flavored wine, highlighted with sweet cherries. At this young stage, it shows more fruit than structure. Tannins are here, likely to flesh out the wine as it develops. For the moment, enjoy the great swathes of sweet fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dark and structured, powered by smoky tannins and plum skin texture. The wine is just beginning, its weight an indication of good aging potential. It is firm and dense, the acidity providing an attractive final freshness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With its fine tannic structure, plum juice sweetness and beautifully ripe fruits, this is a wine that combines structure with a rich velvet coat. The acidity gives a fine lift, bringing out strawberries and a final piercing freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light in color and bright in intensity, this luminous late-harvest Moscadello boasts enormous purity of aromas. The wine is also delicate and feminine with tones of yellow rose, vanilla cream and apricot that accent it's thick, creamy texture. Not cloying or too sweet; would pair well with p\\u00c3\\u00a2t\\u00c3\\u00a9.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has the great aromatic complexity you expect from Rugiens. Generous and full textured, this is a full-bodied, rounded wine. Sweet red fruits, touched by spice, are well balanced with a streak of acidity. Wait for four years, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy aromas quickly transition to ripe marasca cherry and cake spices. The palate delivers juicy red berry, mint and white pepper alongside polished but not very persistent tannins. It's already accessible so drink now through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe black fruit, underbrush, mushroom and forest floor come with a whiff of leather. The palate opens with ripe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094almost sugary tasting\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094black cherry accented with white pepper, cinnamon and Mediterranean herbs alongside firm but fleeting tannins and soft acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak-driven tones of toasted spice, pipe tobacco and bitter chocolate are followed by balsam tones of licorice, cola and dried ginger. There's a touch of fruity richness followed by crisp acidity and forest berry.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sugarille (by Angelo Gaja) is among the top-scoring wines in Montalcino but this edition is weighed down by biting acidity that is characteristic of the 2008 vintage. Modern aromas of black cherry, chocolate and tobacco deliver intensity and power. But the freshness feels sharp and raw at the back of the mouth. Give this wine a few more years to evolve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This garnet colored Brunello opens with a tiny hint of bruised apple skin that gives the bouquet sudden lift or immediacy. Cherry fruit, leather and tobacco are backed by licorice and cola. In the mouth, the wine is toned with textured tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Roasted, toasty aromas are the greeting on this Tempranillo-based blend (20% Cabernet). It's a fresh yet oaky type of Rioja, with resiny creaminess cut by lively acidity. Flavors of vanilla, plum, raspberry and tobacco are traditional, while the finish is mild, crisp and snappy. Hold until 2014 and drink through 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A dusty, mineral quality of lead pencil, brimstone and crushed granite appears at first. It is soon followed by bright cherry, raspberry, leather and tobacco. In the mouth, the wine delivers an elegant and toned quality of tannins with a touch of sour cherry on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Chocolate, sweet spice, tobacco, leather and dark berry fruit give this Brunello a bold and impactful first impression. When it comes to the mouthfeel, the wine plays a more subtle game with polished tannins, mild cherry fruit and a bright point of fresh acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bold and dark, this brawny wine shows beautifully evolved aromas of cured meat, leather, tar, cola and resin backed by candied fruit, pomegranate and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis. That extra muscle helps support the sharpness of the acidity, and plays a promising role in the wine's overall aging potential. Hold 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cherry cola and licorice open the nose of this dark, brooding Brunello. At this young stage, the wine feels slightly sharp and raw in the mouth and it definitely needs another three to five years of cellar aging. Brambly oak and spice give it a zesty and spicy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cava d'Onice is a delightful estate on the eastern side of Montalcino run by a husband and wife team (with two small children). This expression opens with dark fruit and spice backed by bright tones of cherry and toasted almond. In the mouth, it shows structure and mild softness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of freshly-sawn wood set the scene on a wine that is full of new-wood toast and vanilla flavors. The fruit is also present, resulting in a wine that has balanced potential in maybe 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years. A fine effort.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fossacolle's Brunello is distinguished by a chewy texture that is backed by dark concentration and plump berry fruit. The cherry and blackberry layers are thick and soft, but don't let them fool you; Sangiovese's characteristic acidity keeps the palate polished and pristine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a pretty garnet color and subtle aromas of spice, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis, leather and tobacco. The wine shows compact lines with tight structure, bright acidity and a lingering note of smoky ash on the close. The style is traditional, sour and bright.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello opens with inky, dark concentration and definitely shows a chewy, almost raw quality of cherry fruit that will most likely disappear withdonn just two or three more years of cellar aging. Cola, spice, leather and smoke fill in the rear and the wine ends with crisp acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Altesino is part of an elite group of vintners that really put Montalcino on the international wine map. Its 2008 Brunello shows some of the nervous acidity that is typical of the vintage, but it also delivers soft tones of cherry fruit, spice and chocolate that round off any sharp edges.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This selection offers balance and integrated aromas of spice, dark fruit, leather, tobacco, cola and rum cake. The wine shows power and heft both in terms of alcohol and consistency. Smoothly polished, fine tannins appear on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello Selezione epitomizes the clean, polished and easygoing style of the 2008 vintage. The wine shows a savory side with aromas of cured meat and dried herb, as well as a bold fruit side with plush cherry and blackberry. The acidity is high, but is also balanced out by its natural density and rich texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is rather shy and just hints at citrus freshness. The palate, however, fizzes with expressive lively lemon notes which are presented on a light, fruity, inherently fresh and dry body. This is easy and totally refreshing and finishes on a lovely lemon note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Restrained in alcohol, this extreme Sonoma Coast Pinot delivers plenty of flavor, along the lines of funky, earthy licorice and whole-cluster cardamom spice, supported along the way by a pomegranate note. Zingy acidity is present, along with a low imprint of oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: We've noticed traces of volatility in past Sesti Brunellos, but the 2004 vintage smells polished and pristine. Aromas of black fruit, spice and cured meat are intact, generous and are delivered with uplifting force and buoyancy. This helps contribute to the general intensity of the wine and the supple nature of its mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A Syrah-esque bit of smoke and cured meat wafts from this wine aromatically, which follows through on the palate. Bright cherry and currant fruit then intermix with a restrained sense of clove spice, the Stagecoach Cab blended with Malbec and Petit Verdot, aged in 60% new French oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This ripe, sweet-fruited wine is soft and quite mature. Red fruits have developed into a smooth and round texture with a delicate mushroom character. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Millesimato sparkling blend of Pinot Nero and oak-aged Chardonnay delivers a generous and creamy mouthfeel followed by refined aromas of dried fruit and baked bread. This is a beautiful wine to serve with tempura appetizers.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You can taste the age here in the wine's sophisticated and evolved aromas of butterscotch, caramel, dried fruit and pressed flower petal. In fact, this wine comes from the far away 2000 vintage but has beautifully maintained its fruit characteristics and overall crispness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At the age of four-plus years, this Cab still tastes young and fresh, as though it were bottled yesterday. Brims with ripe blackberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar, with a nice cut of acidity and ultrarefined tannins. Not quite ready for prime time, so give it 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years to mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smells raisiny-Porty, and turns dry and austere in the mouth, with modest currant and oak flavors set off by hard tannins. The official alcohol is only 14.9%, but the wine feels hotter than that.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Marks a welcome return to the magnificence of the 2002, although more recent vintages haven't exactly been slouches. The '05 is amazing, a densely structured, deeply flavored Bordeaux blend that's mainly Cabernet Sauvignon. Shows classic notes of cassis, currants and black cherry liqueur, while 70% new oak adds enticingly rich layers of sweet toast and smoky vanilla. The tannins are pure, classic Napa, very refined and ripe, offering solid structural support with no trace of astringency. Beautiful now, and should slowly develop for many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Given time to ferment and age in a majority of neutral oak, this wine still offers thickness and viscosity. It's rich and lush in tropical pineapple, mango and sliced peach, buoyed by acidity and a focused approach.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A grapy, meaty, feral nose is wild, floral and herbal as a whole. This blend of Tempranillo and other Rioja varieties is tannic along its walls. Saucy, grapy, salty flavors are powerful, while the finish is tannic, voluminous and once again grapy like the nose and palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's still a sharpness to this wine, even though it's nearly 4 years old. It shows good blackberry, currant and chocolate-covered cherry flavors, but also a greener streak of mint and oregano that probably limits its ageability.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Bordeaux blend feels harsh in the mouth. It just doesn't offer the richness you want from a Napa wine. The blackberry flavors are edged in overripe raisins, but the biggest problem is the bitter tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine shows many of the characteristics of the vintage; slightly overripe and plummy, not much definition and plenty of alcohol. On the palate, there is plenty of raisiny fruit is at the front of the palate, but little else and the wine is hot and a little unbalanced, and there is slight bubblegum aftertaste.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crushed dill, forest floor and moist earth aromas lead this wine's nose. Its racy palate shows red cherry, strawberry compote, licorice and clove flavors framed by youthful, fine-grained tannins and brisk acidity. A hint of tobacco marks the close. Give this a few more years to mellow before drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with balsamic aromas of camphor, new leather, menthol and exotic spice. The tightly wound palate offers Morello cherry, cranberry, white pepper and grilled sage while assertive, close-grained tannins provide firm support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This savory red boasts star anise, blue flower, new leather, red berry and eucalyptus aromas. On the palate, expect Marasca cherry, cranberry, cinnamon and clove flavors set against firm tannins and racy acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is very rich in blackberries and currants, bearing lots of oak that adds caramelized toastiness. While the tannins are thick and fine, there's something rustic on the finish in the form of extracted, candied sweetness and heat. Flashy as it is, you're best drinking this wine now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Merlot-dominated wine includes 28% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. Its personality has bright and brooding sides, edged with subtle sage perfume, juicy dark cherry flavors and sizable oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a lovely site in the Sebastopol Hills, this wine is tart and tangy with pomegranate and dark cherry flavors, deepened with spicy earth and cardamom accents. It offers length, breadth and a full-bodied expression of the grape and place.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Thick as molasses and dark as caramelized brown sugar, the wine oozes out of the bottle releasing concentrated aromas of butterscotch, toffee, honey, licorice, coffee, resin and maple syrup. Grapes from the Montepulciano area are dried in a ventilated room and the wine ages over 10 years in tiny oak barrels resulting in thick, dark concentration. Don't pair it with food: Vin Santo as good as this deserves to be enjoyed alone, as a so-called \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cmeditation wine.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fragrances recall wet leaves, underbrush, forest berries and baking spices with a touch of espresso. The palate reveals black cherry accented with black pepper and espresso alongside bracing, tongue-drying tannins. This is a big wine, but the fruit isn't quite rich enough to support the evident alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A brawny wine, it leads with ripe berry, underbrush, toast and leather aromas. The juicy palate offers sweet wild cherry and black raspberry accented with notes of mint, thyme, black pepper and hint of coffee alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Balsam, menthol, spice and black and red berry aromas with hints of mint lead the nose on this wine. The palate offers subtle red cherry, prune, tea and tobacco alongside velvety but rather fleeting tannins. It closes on a drying, astringent note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This plump Brunello offers layered aromas of black plum, mature berry, vanilla, and balsamic notes with a hint of leather. The ripe, one-dimensional palate first reveals rich, sweet black cherry, black pepper and cocoa but concludes rather abruptly with a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows Pride's house style, a wildly bold, mountain-concentrated wine that couldn't possibly be fruitier or riper. Intense flavors of blackberries, blueberries and cedar are wrapped into complex but gentle tannins, making the wine drinkable now. But it should develop over the next 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bold as always, with a ton of cedar, graphite, blackberry, vanilla and coconut notes on the nose. This is huge, tough and ripe, with massive blackberry, caf\\u00c3\\u00a9 mocha and vanilla flavors. It finishes hard but with a cascade of sweet fruit, marshmallow, coconut cake, herb and vanilla. Needs a few more years to settle. Drink after 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a sophisticated blend of Carignano, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, and it's always delightful. This vintage shows intense, soft notes of dried sage and rosemary.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Franc is a difficult variety on its own, but Jarvis does an excellent job. This is still quite tannic, with a hard, astringent mouthfeel to the cherry, blackberry and dark-chocolate flavors. Give this a few more years of aging, although it doesn't seem like a longterm ager.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gary Farrell's Bordeaux blend is quite good and well-made, but it isn't showing much complexity now. It's a big, tannic wine that impresses with its blast of fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, cocoa all swamp the palate, along with smoky oak notes. Maybe it will do interesting things in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's oak, toasted nut and menthol aromas carry over to its evolved palate, along with a coffee note and bracing tannins. It's shy on fruit richness and intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's oak, weedy underbrush, celery and vegetable broth aromas carry over to the lean palate, along with a roasted coffee bean note. Raspy tannins clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Quite elegant, but not showing well given the price, being somewhat soft and direct in candied blackberries, cherries and chocolate-covered mint. The vintage was a difficult one for St. Sup\\u00c3\\u00a9ry. The wine is lacks the stuffing for ageability. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Just lovely to drink now, it's so softly lush and decadently delicious. Beguiles the palate with jammy, pastry flavors of raspberries, cherries and sweet oak. Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent. But you'll also easily discover the vast richness of chocolate, cherry, blackberry and currant fruit, so deep and impressive, and the finish is totally dry and balanced. This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This new offering combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Tempranillo, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot from the mountain site.

The wine is already well integrated, showing dense red fruits as well as structure. A touch of wood will soften soon. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It hasn't all come together yet in this young wine, and it's hard to predict where it's going. Fresh and juvenile, it shows ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit, with some hard-edged tannins and a bitterness in the finish. Could come together, but the absence of prior vintages makes it a guessing game.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gentle and candy ripe, this Cab has pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries, red plums, licorice and chocolate, accented with toasty, spicy oak, wrapped into sweet, fine tannins. Too soft for the cellar, so drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is overpowering, almost too much.

For those who like superconcentrated wines, this will be a big hit, but not with food.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark, soft, full-bodied and slightly sweet, this Pinot clearly shows its warm-climate origins. It tastes of jammy blackberries, cherries and raspberries.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Super earthy, this wine shows pomegranate, rhubarb and a touch of smoke, the aromas perfumed in rose petal.

It's very rich, bursting with flavors of blackberry and balsamic vinegar that evolve toward creosote and tar, all wrapped up in silky tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk.

A slightly hollow but round finish with mild residual tannins suggests that this be drunk now through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Whatever the blend is on this red wine, and winemaker Heidi Barrett isn't saying, it's really interesting. The bottle is old-fashioned and stubby, like something from the 1700s. The wine itself is immediately likeable for its spicy array of spices and berries.

While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: No doubt, this is a big, bold wine that hits the palate like a ton of bricks. Aromas include maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, dark fruit and plum, spice and leather. Not surprisingly, it delivers loads of sticky chewiness as well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An individualistic, some would say eccentric wine, made from grapes grown all over the valley. Your first impression is of jammy sweetness: blackberries, cherries, raspberries, oak. Then the tannins kick in, bringing needed dryness.

Rich and full-bodied, it has a vanilla-kissed nose and earthy leather pedigree, the black cherry flavor concentrated and thick.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At the moment the pleasant fruit seems completely overmatched by the heavily charred, smoky barrel flavors.

Medium bodied and velvety, it follows through in cassis and pomegranate flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, oak, wild berry, herb and balsamic notes lead the nose of this Brunello.

Black pepper and a nutty entry invite one in to explore further, this wine having many stories to tell as it develops. Soft and mellow, it's also feral and funky, with a strong essence of mushroomy forest floor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's the stem inclusion that shows itself first, with aromas of olive and herb in front of violets, red fruit, pepper, earth and whiffs of coffee and smoked meat. The flavors are reserved, supple and polished, with bright acids keeping it all in focus. It demands food alongside it to be properly appreciated.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Given slightly less new oak (60%) than the producer's Les Sommets bottling, this is an equally rewarding wine, blended with 12% Merlot. Red fruit dominates atop a soft grip of leather, pencil lead and cedar.

Almost Burgundian in style, it possesses excellent length and wonderful texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 2010 Widowmaker shows a bit more fruit, less funk than usual.

New oak plays a prominent role, both in toasty flavors and in wood tannins.

The medium-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and grilled sage alongside fresh acidity and taut tightly knit tannins. Drink after 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, new leather, pressed violet, ripe berry, Mediterranean herb and eucalyptus aromas lead the way on this robust red. The densely concentrated palate shows raisin, vanilla, prune and espresso alongside the warmth of evident alcohol. Chewy tannins provide support while a hint of licorice wraps up the finish. Give it a few years to unwind, then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wines from Morey-Saint-Denis should be opulent in 2005, and this wine has opulence in spades. It fills the mouth with rich red plums, red cherries and some cranberry juice to give an edge of dryness. Maybe complexity is edged out by all this juicy fruit, but the tannins do firm up the wine, which should certainly age 10 years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, burly Pinot Noir, dominated by black cherries, rich fruit and firm tannins. This is wine that shows richness, with a smoky, chewy structure and great spice and aromatic perfumes. The juiciness comes through on the finish, but never leaves the structure behind.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intensely perfumed, this wine shows both strength and great elegance. The raspberry flavors float over a light structure of some dry tannins. The acidity is there, but it is the generosity of the fruit that is most obvious, going right through the wine to the sweet, jammy finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A lush and expansive, small-production wine, this weaves together dark fruit with streaks of cedar and herb, its texture fleshy, full bodied and powerful. The tannin and oak are nicely integrated, allowing for a balance of structure and flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Not as rich or chewy as the Diamond Mountain Ranch bottling, Sterling's 2004 Reserve Cabernet is immediately accessible, offering aromas and flavors of cassis and dried spices and soft tannins. A good steak house red.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, porcini mushroom, chopped mint, used leather and eucalyptus aromas lead the nose. It's robust and somewhat one-dimensional, with flavors suggesting prune, dried cherry marinated in spirits, fig and a hint of cinnamon alongside big but not very persistent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This big-shouldered blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petit Verdot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Merlot offers soft waves of black fruit and smoky oak. It's accented with meatier elements of brick and tobacco.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Marzemino, this has subtle aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of cake spice. The concentrated monolithic palate delivers prune, vanilla and a hint of bitter almond alongside assertive tannins. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol. Drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deliciously heady notes of peach and chamomile immediately hit the nose, promising ripeness and aromatic riches. The palate does not disappoint, releasing even more of those wonderfully balm-like, aromatic flavors. It brightens them with wondrous lemon freshness and boosts them with a poised dose of residual sweetness. It's an unusual wine that does not really fit any category but sits in a delicious aromatic off-dry class of its own. The best option with this probably is cheese, but it will serve well as a philosopher's wine, savored on its own. It has enough depth and beauty to nourish sustained thought. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Right now this is still shy on the nose. There is a glint of pear peel and Mirabelle, plus a suggestion of smoke. The palate is equally shy as the principal sensation is that of wonderfully tangy texture, fresh concentrated acidity and balanced sweetness right now. This needs time to develop its undoubtedly rich flavors. The balance is impeccable. Immense power and lasting strength lie at the core of this monumental wine. This is made to last and should be given time in the cellar. Drink 2025\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932050.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is still closed but already gives glimpses of citrus zestiness. The palate is a riot of both fresh and candied peel, think Seville orange, tangerine and Meyer lemon. The zesty freshness of the citrus fruit always has the upper hand on this energetic, exuberant late harvest wine and counters the residual sweetness perfectly. Killer acidity and utter concentration create a magnetic, delicious, age-worthy wine. The finish is off dry and refreshing, with a sweetish glint here and there. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932040 at least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Smoke and the merest, tantalizing whiff of toffee apple can be discerned on the nose. Fragrant herbs\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094think chervil and yarrow\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094also make an appearance. The palate is dry but brims with ripe lemon oil and fresh lemon fruit. This is streamlined and impactful, with a commanding, overarching freshness that only enforces the inherent power of this site more. For now this is tightly wound and still closed, majoring on its ample lemon charm but this needs bottle age to let the myriad notes promised on the nose unfold on the palate. Drink 2022\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932040.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Earth, smoke and lifted lemon peel create a very alluring, almost primal aroma. The palate comes in with gentle, subdued sweetness, boosting ripe pear notes before revealing fir honey bitterness and tangy grapefruit zest. A warm sandalwood-spiced core is still tightly closed, holding further stores of fruit and spice and signalling lasting power and barely tamed energy. While aromas are enticing now this deserves cellaring to come into its own. There is much drive and a dynamic citrus freshness wills you to sip more. This draws you in dangerously. The finish is dry and totally enticing. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932040.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A floral touch of honeysuckle plays spicily on the nose alongside aromatic Williams pear. The palate adds a sonorous and pleasant bitterness to this, reminiscent of fir honey, while the floral overtones of honeysuckle shimmer everywhere. There is quite some warmth and energy in this wine, smouldering at the very core. This is lovely now but is sure to last with all its brooding power. The finish is long and dry and returns to that pure note of Williams pear. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A tender notion of slightly bitter, dark fir honey appears first before a touch of smoke and ripe peach come in. The off-dry palate uses its sweetness to underline the rich peachy fruit that also has a touch of golden mirabelle. The big bold palate is concentrated and energetic, pervaded by a streak of zesty lemon freshness that keeps this from becoming too rich. There is undeniable drive here, and a very lasting persistent length of peach and lemon flavors which will develop much more with bottle age. Drink. 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932037.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tender notes of orange peel and pear skin reach the nose. The palate shows a vivid note of orange peel, with an herbal hint of mint and a wonderfully light, fluid touch. There is concentration but also poise, absolute dryness and wonderful length.

Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a meticulously farmed site, this robust wine is intense and powerful, with a baked fruit component that makes it compelling and delicious. Forest floor, sage and rhubarb jam notes enwrap its concentrated weight and texture, with an underlying acidity that tingles the tongue.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: What a heady nose. Tangerine peel, hay flowers and ripe apples all dance and swirl across the senses. The palate takes the swirling fruit and fragrance up a notch, heightened with the intensity of tangy lemon freshness. This has utter precision and concentration, there almost seems to be a life force of stone and power behind it. It's a textbook Riesling with a clean, dry and totally tangy moreish finish. Lovely now but with great potential. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very ripe flavors of berries and figs dominate this Cab-centric Bordeaux blend, along with intriguing side notes suggesting melon and cassis, smoke and mocha. It's a big, sexy wine, its fruit flavors backed with thick, ripe, but chalky tannins. If there is a downside, it is that it comes off as a bit monolithic.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As befits a single vineyard Gevrey Chambertin, this is a structured wine, firmly rooted in tannins. Hidden beneath are black plum and cherry flavors that are raring to go\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094rich and sumptuous. It's a wine for aging, so drink from 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Full-throttle Burgundian technique marks this Chardonnay. It's explosive with buttered toast and popcorn and apricot and orange jam flavors. There's a fine streak of lime acidity. It's an exciting wine, as opulent as California Chard gets, if a little over-the-top, venturing beyond balance into opulence for its own sake.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an attractive, fast-maturing wine with soft tannins, ripe fruits and a juicy, perfumed acidity. It has considerable weight and concentration, along with firm red-plum and berry flavors. It's an elegant wine that should be drunk from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very mineral in style, this is a structured, textured wine with good aging potential. It's acidity, still pronounced and up front, reveals itself with crisp citrus flavors that accent warm yellow fruits. The wine needs a year or two before drinking, so wait until 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: High alcohol is giving this 100% Cabernet some inherent instability that warrants against extended aging. However, if you drink it soon, you'll find a vastly rich, opulent wine, with blackberry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors whose tannins reflect Napa's best. A fabulous steak, perfectly charred and prepared, will make you drain the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rubbery, rooty aromas of herbs and berries blend with stalky red-fruit notes. This feels shrill and tangy, with hard tannins, while flavors of roasted berry fruits come with a leafy undercurrent. Roasted, herbal, oaky flavors settle in on a juicy, high-acid finish. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blends 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot into a tightly woven package of red fruit, soft tannin and robust concentration. Full bodied, it shows the warmth and distinct power of the vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 61% Cabernet Franc, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Merlot is dense and boldly tannic, with varietal characteristics of dried herb and a fruity core reminiscent of wild blackberry.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Plum, baking spice, pressed blue flower and tobacco aromas emerge on this full-bodied red. Showing the heat of the vintage, the palate is rather evolved, displaying dried cherry and licorice alongside firm tannins. Drink over the next few years to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subdued on the nose, this wine still needs to stretch its proverbial muscles. Its flavors of cherry liqueur, rum cake, blackberry and forest underbrush give voice to a clean, traditional winemaking philosophy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing youthful oak tones that still need time to integrate, this wine is a bit sour and ripe at the same time. Black cherry, tobacco, leather and spice aromas are nice, but the tannins are firm, and the wine shows a bright point of acidity on the close and a gritty, cooked-fruit finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bracing and tightly wound, this opens with subdued aromas of pressed rose, resin and a whiff of exotic spice. The evolved palate isn't in sync with the nose, offering raisin and a touch of anise as well as aggressive, astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, raspy finish. It's already drying out so drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big wine both in terms of consistency and alcohol (17%). In fact, it's too big in many respects and it's hard to image what foods can stand up to this power. The wine is redolent of brambly sour notes of earth and forest floor and there's a touch of bitter astringency on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blueberry, blackberry, black cherry and ground black pepper aromas lead the nose and carry through to the full-bodied palate together with notes of clove, tobacco and mint. It's balanced with firm, velvety tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Floral in jasmine and orange blossom, this is a sultry, full-bodied after-dinner sipper, lilting in honey goodness yet light in stone fruit and layered acidity. It is enjoyable on its own but would be fabulous alongside a peach pie or apricot tart.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with dried Nebbiolo grapes and aged in new barriques, this bold wine opens with aromas of baked plum, resin, nutmeg and grilled herb. The warm palate offers ripe black cherries, steeped prunes, espresso, black pepper, licorice and mint chocolate alongside velvety tannins. You'll detect the warmth of alcohol on the mid palate, but it doesn't dominate the rich flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The small Pauillac vineyard close to some of the first growths is able to bring out all the Cabernet-dominated structure of the appellation. Look for black currant fruits, dark tannins and dense texture. Age for six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This big, fruity black-colored wine has ripe stone fruit flavors and firm, ripe tannins. There is structure, obvious aging potential as well as ripe, sweet juicy Merlot fruit flavors. Age for 5-6 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Carob, sour cherry, bramble, leafy greens and exotic spice are some of the eclectic aromatic components of this wine's bright bouquet. The more you sniff, the more you get pipe tobacco, forest fruit and blackberry. The mouthfeel is firm, tonic and compact.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of smoky cigar, toasted note and black cherry open the bouquet of this bright expression from Montalcino. The wine shows good density and a tonic, crisp feel on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Boscarelli offers a dark, meaty and sophisticated expression of Vino Nobile with gritty tannins, dark berry fruit and plum, followed by loads of spice, tar and resin. Softer oak tones of vanilla and cinnamon appear on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of cellar floor, roasted herb, anise and toast come together on this. The straightforward palate offers cherry marinated in spirits and licorice while a note of powdered sage gives it a bitter finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak, espresso and toast aromas take center stage and follow through to the tightly wound palate along with a hint of butterscotch, coconut and the barest hint of dried cherry. It possesses structure but lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the assertive tannins and evident oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is just delicious, showing all the fine attributes you'd want from a California Cabernet, except ageability. But who cares, when it's this rich in blackberry and cherry jam, cassis and chocolate, and so balanced? Winemaker John Falcone has brought his years of thoughtful winemaking to this Cab, and of course the favorable 2009 vintage helped.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 90% Grenache and 10% Syrah from the Armada Vineyard, this expresses its characteristic mix of superripe fruit and organic funk. Cracker, berry, spice and earth components all seem to compete a bit in the mouth and need more bottle time to fully meld together.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Roasted and rubbery, this features potent leather and compost aromas that settle with airing. Angular, aggressive and full of power and lemony oak, it also has raw wood and heavily toasted black-fruit flavors. Long, peppery and choppy, it's powerful and stomping. Best to hold this for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years before drinking, when it should emerge as a better, more approachable wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is supersmooth and attractive, with earth, cola, tobacco, balsam and solid berry aromas.

Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This borderline overripe big boy tosses out aromas of raisin, baked black plum and jammy black currant. It's lush, solid and steady, but blocky on the palate. Flavors of cassis and black cherry finish with ripe, sweet flavors of brown sugar, cassis and chocolate. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Burly in black fruit, leather and cigar, this is a smoky, full-bodied and powerful wine, richly textured in toasted oak and supple tannin. Blackberry and black currant play off each other to provide a juicy core of consistency. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This combines a majority of Cabernet with 4% Malbec for a huge, powerfully made wine, aged almost two years in French oak.

Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From vineyards on Diamond Mountain as well as Atlas Peak and Calistoga, this majority Cabernet employs 7% Petit Verdot, giving it a tad more weight and tannin. It otherwise is a high-toned and herbal wine, offering a taste of black tea amid chocolate and black cherry, finishing in fine-grained tannin and oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 85% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 5% Syrah, this opens with aromas of brimstone, allspice, dried black-skinned fruit and a whiff of olive brine. The full-bodied palate delivers ripe black cherry, plum, vanilla and white pepper alongside chewy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Jammy, overripe fruit does not help this wine. Its soft tannins and acidity provide some pleasure, but that clumsy fruit gets in the way.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine smells more like an Amarone than a Brunello. Aromas recall nail varnish, raisin, prune and overripe black fruit with whiffs of toast and espresso. The extracted, one-dimensional palate offers black plum, mature blackberries, oak, vanilla, coffee, and the warmth of noticeable alcohol alongside bracing tannins. Overall, it lacks finesse and nuance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This starts with aromas that recall a closed cellar; these quickly burn off to reveal dominant oak sensations accented with meat juices and hints of mature black plum. The palate offers sweet, almost sugared black cherry, espresso and stewed plums alongside astringent wood tannins. It's rather evolved so enjoy soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pale in the extreme, this wood-aged wine is a sister to the estate's top cuv\\u00c3\\u00a9e, Garrus.

The intensity and purity are amazing and the wine is sophisticated, soft and very rich on the finish.

From the lower, southern side of Montalcino, this interpretation focuses on quality fruit aromas, crispness and a sense of clean linearity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright, clean and linear with pretty accents of spice, blackberry, leather and lingering tobacco, Villa al Cortile Riserva is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with a hearty meat dinner. The wine shows velvety, soft texture in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ugolforte Brunello opens with perfumed aromas of blue flower, wild berries, white cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and a slight hint of toasted coconut. In fact, those oak-driven aromas could use more time to integrate. The mouthfeel, however, is more evolved at this stage with bright acidity and a spicy aftertaste.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lush and delicious, if a little soft, with palate-flattering flavors of black currants, milk chocolate and cedar, and sweet herbs like dill and sage. Very smooth and seductive. Doesn't seem to have the structure for aging, but an elegant wine for now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a sophisticated and elegant Amarone with very forward use of oak that supports its soft, velvety curves. The wine boasts thick concentration, an inky color and loads of spice, candied fruit and tobacco. It's full and soft with velvety tannins and a long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeously extracted and dense wine with thick concentration and intense notes of ripe fruit, blackberry jam, dried currant, tar, asphalt and resin. The aromas are immediate and opulent but the wine also delivers a streamlined and polished mouthfeel that suits it very nicely.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Remo Farina is an excellent operation (now taken over by the next generation and currently undergoing a winery refurbishment) and the estate's beautiful Monte Fante Amarone is thickly extracted with mature aromas of black fruit, apple, cola and exotic spice. The wine offers character and pizzazz thanks to the polished quality of its tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh and vibrant aromas of dark cherry and purple flowers get serious weight from a touch of tar on this very balanced, tighter Cabernet. Dark red fruits, sweet plums (and their more tart skins) and even blueberry show on the palate, which is equally acidic and tannic. It's neither lean nor lush, but right down the middle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of coffee, espresso, toast, black plum, vanilla and berry fruit open this wine. The straightforward palate delivers rich black cherry accented with vanilla, chocolate and licorice alongside tight tannins that leave an astringent finish. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Surprisingly ripe and dense for the vintage, this opens with aromas of plum, vanilla and chocolate that carry over to the palate along with espresso and coffee. It has a forward nature with tame acidity and soft tannins that make it already accessible. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Plummy cinnamon notes meet fruity coconut depth in this ripe, soft and brightly constructed wine that's rich and full-bodied.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A proportion of the grapes in this wine, accented with 2% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, comes from the Lewis Vineyard, a respected site in the heart of the appellation. It contributes to the magic, putting forward red currant, sage and crisp red fruit around a strong body, texture and tang of tannin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This juicy cuv\\u00c3\\u00a9e is aged entirely in French oak, blending Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre with Syrah, Grenache and Cinsault to good effect. High acidity marks the palate, giving it freshness amid the earthiness of blueberry and leather.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Loaded with underbrush sensations, this opens with aromas of porcini mushroom, truffle, charred soil and a whiff of baked plum. The big, generous palate offers fleshy black cherry, vanilla, a confectionary note and a hint of game alongside ripe tannins. The fruit richness seamlessly supports the hefty 15% abv. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: If Margaux is the most delicate of the M\\u00c3\\u00a9doc wines, then this is the epitome of Margaux. It is light, poised and attractively perfumed. The fruit is elegant and fresh with a fine streak of acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This big, burly Cab is a Napa Valley tradition. The cedar and cassis aromas and flavors are classic, but boast an untamed, briary wildness to them that gives Bosche its own identity. Finishes long but tart, with mouth-drying tannins that need time to resolve. Drink 2007-2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The complex nose boasts hints of spring flowers, tobacco, maple syrup and cedar. Now into its second decade, this wine is fully mature, with flavors of molasses and mushrooms that have replaced some of the cherry notes of its youth. The mouthfeel is silky and elegant; the finish chocolaty and smooth. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A solid, chunky structure is the hallmark of this big wine. The fruit is black, full of dark tannins. Perhaps it lacks subtlety, but that is replaced with great power and potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Great depth of fruit characterizes this wine from its beautiful bouquet of ripe sour cherries, tar, taragon, earth and tobacco right through its solid palate where the rich dry cherry flavors open up and show some mineral accents.  Long and elegant, the finish has even, ripe tannins and a fine chalky note.  Deserves cellaring for two to four more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberries are the story here, boatloads of rich, ripe, jammy blackberries. There is just a whiff of volatile acidity, then a wonderful mouthful of fruit with some stony earth underneath. Shows a light touch with the oak, good acids and a deft handling of the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll absolutely love this wine. Barbaresco Santo Stefano offers intensity, harmony and imparts delicious aromas of sweet spice, wild berries, licorice, tar and light touches of smoke or graphite. It boasts a smooth, rich texture with bright acidity on the close. This is a very pure and pristine expression of Nebbiolo that will live long in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, concentrated, and loaded with smoky, dark, spicy fruit flavors, this is a full-on Bordeaux blend, with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot. There's plenty of barrel influence, from 70% new French oak, but it's welcome, and appropriate, perfectly matched to the power of the fruit. An underlayer of woodsy earth and mushroom adds further complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With fruit sourced from some of Barolo's best vineyard crus, this beautiful wine offers fullness, character and longevity. Textbook Nebbiolo aromas include wild berry, blue flower, white pepper, cola and tar. The mouthfeel is spicy, fresh and well structured. Pair this wine with steak au poivre (in 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years or so).\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Nei Cannubi from Poderi Einaudi is textbook Barolo; the kind of wine you can bank on for an elegant and enlightening drinking experience. You see that, here, all the elements are perfectly in place and stacked for maximum pleasure. Aromas of blue flower, berry and shaved mineral build in intensity and the wine is determined and persistent on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thanks to its dense clay soils, the Brunate cru delivers wines with high color saturation and aromatic caliber. This Barolo offers layers of black fruit, plum, spice, tobacco, cola and dark chocolate. The wine is firm and finely textured with power, dimension and personality on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Luigi Pira estate delivers a knockout Barolo (from the Marenca vineyard in Serralunga d'Alba) with impressive integrity of fruit, vibrant cherry and blackberry backed by warming aromas of chocolate and spice. The wine is velvety-rich and opulent in the mouth. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a tannic toughness to this young wine. It's like chewing on dried black currants. Once they start to dissolve in the mouth, lovely flavors of sweet blackberries emerge, and then take over through a very long, spicy finish. It's quite a beautiful Napa Cabernet, but it does need time. Best 2013\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The blend is almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc, with some Carmenet and Petit Verdot blended in for complexity. The wine is easy to like now for its dryness and elegance, despite relatively high alcohol. It shows California ripeness of fruit, with a smooth integration of oak. If there's a criticism, it's excessive softness. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a soft, earthy wine, with dried herb and currant flavors. It comes down on the subtle side, with a bit of oak influence adding richness to the wine's otherwise dry texture. Drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The attack, or entry, of this Merlot is a massive assault of flavor. It's all raspberry and cherry jam, dark chocolate and the creamy caramel of new oak. Delicious, yes, but where's the subtlety? Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of lemon drop, dried yellow flower, vanilla and butterscotch carry to the palate, along with toast, golden apple and a hint of savory herb. Balanced with bright acidity, it closes on a mineral note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tight tannins support a blend of 49% Cabernet Sauvignon with 21% Petit Verdot, 11% Merlot and 9% Cabernet Franc. Black fruit, tobacco and leather give it a robust profile, finishing full bodied and ripe.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This robust red opens with aromas of toast, baked plum, menthol, espresso and vanilla that carry over to the warm, densely concentrated palate along with blackberry jam, licorice and oak-driven spice. You'll notice the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate while close-grained tannins give it an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a full and luminous white wine (made with Chardonnay) that boasts a lively and vibrant character. A pleasure to drink, the wine is redolent of stone fruit, citrus, white stone and almond nut.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bold, succulent black cherry and currant flavors combine with softer, more elegant notions of graphite, coffee and clove in this well-made, full-bodied, 100% varietal wine. Volcanic soils comprise the Sonoma Mountain slope where the vineyard is located, contributing a gravelly hint of reduction.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Woody, herbal and integrated in oak and tannin, this wine comes from grapes grown in both Sonoma Valley estate vineyards and sites in Alexander and Knights valleys. Red currant, graphite and clove flavors highlight its medium-bodied density.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon makes up half of this wine, with the balance Merlot (31%), Malbec (15%) and Cabernet Franc. Barrel notes of vanilla and baking spice are up front, followed by herb and dark fruit tones that are backed by lively acidity. It currently drinks very tight. Give it some time in the cellar or an extended decant. Best after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft in classic layers of cinnamon and clove, this wine is almost entirely Cabernet Sauvignon, with a wealth of black plum and blackberry constituting its inner soul. The finish lingers in black pepper and more of that opening spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard planted on the edge of Freestone by James MacPhail of MacPhail Family Wines and respected grower Jim Pratt, this wine opens with a splash of white pepper that persists on the soft, silky palate. Roses and black tea provide savory flavor, with an intensity of forest floor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Bordeaux-style blend, which this year contains a bit of Syrah, seems to vary vintage to vintage. The '05 is based on Cabernet Franc. It shows a fine structure and is very dry and tannic, but needs time to soften. However, the oak-infused black cherry, black currant, violet and anise flavors are impressive. Best after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine opens with a beautiful amber color and offers nut, dried apricot, honey, resin and orange zest. It has a thick, gritty quality with toasted flavors of roasted chestnut and loads of luscious sweetness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark, ripe and handsome. Those are the basics on this showy wine. Aromas of leather, shoe polish and char darken up the berry fruit, while flavors of blackberry and plum vie with oak-based mocha. Plenty of length and potential on the finish, but also some hard oak that needs more time to get absorbed. Best in 2009\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932010.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tastes brittle and aloof in its youth, with a very dry mouthfeel dominated by acidity and tannins, although the texture is silky and smooth. You don't want to open this too soon. Given the core of cherries and pomegranates, it should develop, but no guarantees. The Freestone area is very cool and its possibilities are unknown but promising.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: COS is a nod to the three friends who founded the winery, Giambattista Cilia, Giusto Occhipinti and Cirino Strano. This beautiful Nero d'Avola opens with bright berry aromas, toasted pistachio nut and bright accents of chopped herbs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Frank Cornelissen is one of the rising stars of Italy's natural wine movement. Munjebel 7 (he does editions, instead of vintages) shows a bright ruby appearance with suspended particles that give it a slightly cloudy appearance. The aromas are fine, delicate and complex with wild berry, crushed granite and dusty earth. His wines are aged in large clay amphorae.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Initially a very soft wine, it slowly shows its ripe fruits, intense texture and blend of buttery toast and acidity. Yellow fruits dominate, bursting through the acidity to give a ripe, opulent finish. Age for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big, tannic, midnight black Cabernet, rude in youth and barely drinkable. The tannins are powerful enough to lock down the palate. The grapes, grown in Calistoga, are very ripe in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, but those tannins are stubbornly astringent. Almost old-fashioned in toughness despite very high alcohol, it's a curiosity that seems likely to develop in the cellar, but with so little evidence of past vintages, all bets are off.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rounded wine, although still young. It has ripe fruit, creamed apples and fresh acidity. The wood flavors give an extra smoothness as well as a more complex long-lasting finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crafted from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, in almost equal parts, this delicately tinted wine is subtle with flavors of strawberries, peaches and oranges. It has a honeyed finish, making it slightly off-dry. The acidity is pitch perfect and the mousse is fine and silky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pale gold colored wine with a soft texture, light wood touches and ripe yellow fruits. The wine is rich, warm, opulent in character, open and fruity. A touch of texture brings out the acidity at the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This classic Amarone has a fragrance of blackberry and spice. The palate delivers succulent but restrained black cherry flavor, with accents of white pepper, nutmeg and almond. It's structured, but also has just enough freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Amarone offers blackberry, plum, and chocolate flavors layered with licorice, black pepper and vanilla notes from the well-integrated oak. This is structured, but it also has finesse. Drink after 2016 for additional complexity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A powerfully rich and concentrated Bordeaux-style blend of 81% Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of four other Bordeaux varieties, this wine presents itself as juicy and fresh on entry, with high-toned sparks of cranberry, cherry and cassis. It takes on more strength and structure as it opens, suggesting its worth for the cellar. Hold until 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This beautiful wine includes 9% Cabernet Franc that gives a lift of floral violet and grainy cedar. Classic all around in its etchings of coconut shavings, graphite, spice and dust, the fruit is additionally savory in bright red currant and a crunch of cassis, with an underpinning of soft, succulent blackberry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pear and anise introduce this robust, voluptuous wine that's brimming in high-toned acidity. It becomes more lengthy and complex as it develops in the glass. Touches of baked pineapple provide a tropical edge amid wintertime nutmeg and spiced lemon. This is a beautiful, full-bodied wine that's lush and memorable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Doug Boeschen has but one acre of this variety, and he puts it to tremendous use here, in this tamed, food-friendly expression of a robust grape. This vintage is his first single-bottling of PV. Soft, integrated tannin supports juicy black currant and a svelte layering of dark chocolate, punctured by an arsenal of beautiful violet aromas.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Vibrant and loaded with finesse, this blend of 80% Sangiovese, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc opens with enticing scents of red woodland berry, new leather, Asian spice and a touch of menthol. The youthful palate delivers red currant, wild cherry, star anise and clove alongside a backbone of firm acidity and polished, tightly wound tannins. It will age majestically; drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932033.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine launched cinematically by Robert Redford in \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIndecent Proposal,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d this delivers a succulently memorable and seductive mix of crisp cassis and meaty rare beef, a sanguine underpinning that gives it intrigue. Full bodied and ripely crafted, it is completely satisfying in its classical components of sage and cedar, with a lingering lust of chocolate-covered cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the only producer to source Zin from this famous vineyard, this wine is abundant in a complexity of baked bread, blackberry jam and vanilla, with endless depth on the palate. Fresh and juicy, it balances its fruitiness with mountain-sized tannin strength and concentration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This smoky, earthy, soft and delicate wine comes from an estate vineyard planted in 1999 in the Occidental Hills. Rose petals and cranberry mingle effortlessly on the silky palate, while a bite of black tea and tannin tease on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a strong sense of coconut that abruptly hits pomegranate and cranberry on the palate. The sweetness of the coconut dissipates on the finish, which veers slightly sour.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brightly perfumed with violet aromas, this is a soft, round and voluptuously lush red wine. Full-bodied, it shows leather and baked black cherry notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas are alluring, with notes of stem, dried herb, white pepper, cigar box and raspberry. The palate is chock-full of raspberry flavors that show a pleasing purity, and the finish lingers, showing just a touch of heat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black spice, root beer, tar and a touch of smoke are backed by prune, plum and dried currants. You'll also recognize aromas of green olive or caper and this Riserva Barbaresco is very elegant and feminine overall. Don't wait too long to drink this wine, it's at its height now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a Riserva Barolo from the excellent 2004 vintage with elegant and traditional characteristics and evolved aromas of smoked meat, pressed fruit, chopped spice and moist earth. The wine seems older than it is and ends with meaty flavors of cured beef and honey roasted ham.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With fruit sourced from Barbaresco, Treiso and Neive, this elegant wine will surprise you with its aromatic intensity. Bright aromas of cinnamon, clove, black pepper and mature currant pop out on the nose. Subtle shades of licorice, prune and tobacco appear in the background and the wine is bright, firm and enduring in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Savigny-l\\u00c3\\u00a8s-Beaune, better known for its reds, also makes small quantities of white. From a three-acre parcel, this wine is ripe and tangy with orange peel and mineral acidity. It is a wine that is aging fast and that will be ready to drink from late 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bottling of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre presents a dusty, slightly sweet-smelling nose, with blackberry syrup and leather aromas. Juicy blueberries and blackberries lead into a sip laced with licorice, tobacco and lava rock, finishing on a note of burnt caramel. It's quite dense so needs lots of time to open up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a challenging Napa Valley vintage, this red is made in what the winemaker calls a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cRight Bank\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d style, blending 56% Cabernet Franc with 42% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon from vineyards such as Hyde in Carneros. The wine is brimming in dark plum and severe chocolate and cherry, with a reasonable amount of grip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo offers tobacco leaf, porcini mushroom, roasted coffee bean and espresso aromas. The palate delivers ripe plum and coffee notes, and ripe, round tannins. This isn't a very typical expression of Barolo, but it's enjoyable. It's already approachable. Drink it now and over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nothing subtle about this Zin, which offers a heady blast of grilled raspberries and cherries. It's a robust wine, with lots of alcohol and spices and a rich finish. This is your go-to summer barbecue wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barbaresco has an unusual but appealing fragrance of incense, exotic spice and black fruit. The palate shows more classic Nebbiolo characters of cherry and spice, as well as oak-driven sensations of roasted coffee bean and vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While this wine is still dense and tannic, it also has great layers of blackberry and black plum fruits that give richness. So although it is structured, it is also full and ripe, hinting at a delicious, generous future.

It's a very pretty and compelling expression of the variety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with a handful of Merlot and Petit Verdot, this wine is on the cooler-climate side of the sensory equation, a note of pencil and olive here, a bit of juicy cranberry there. Chalky tannins complete the picture, the wine balanced and medium to light in weight.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Charred, tarry, smoky aromas are gritty and outpace this boutique wine's fruit character. Hard and tannic, with citric acidity, this is steered by flavors of charred oak, licorice, chocolate and barrel resin. Toasty, spicy raspberry and blackcurrant flavors finish it up. Drink through 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, ripe berry and cake spice aromas emerge in the glass.

Tasted four times.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This '04 is off a beat from the '03, showing a tiredness that may be a result of the heat. It's soft, with candied blackberry and cherry flavors that finish dry, and is not ageworthy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Time will only help this tough, rough Priorato that isn't offering a whole lot now besides tannin, dark-fruit flavors and searing oak.

Should be more revealing in a few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet is tannic, acidic and dry, yet remarkably fruity as well.

It's not yet ready to drink, so give it at least six years in the cellar, and possibly far longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Usually employed as a blending grape, Petit Verdot stands on its own two feet here, yielding a dry, sophisticated wine. With a full body and sizable tannins, it's rich and aromatic with blackberry, cassis and violet notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This straight Barolo has an exotic fragrance of spice, sandalwood and incense, while the palate shows ripe raspberry, spice and balsamic herbs. It's tannic and shy on acidity, typical of the hot 2007 vintage. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A unique blend of Syrah (78%), Cabernet Sauvignon (13%) and Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, this low-alcohol wine (for the vintage and region) offers aromas of high-toned dried herbs, earth, smoked meat, smoke and white pepper. The citrusy fire-pit flavors are elegant and show persistence. It's a unique expression of the area that should do well on the dinner table.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Funky aromas of scorched earth, overripe plum, game and a whiff of barnyard lead the nose. The palate has a raw quality, showing unripe red berry, leather, cured meat and a hint of chewing tobacco. Overall, this is rustic and lacks fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A mix of 37% Zinfandel, 32% Syrah and 31% Petite Sirah, this is a burly, thick and syrupy concoction from a high-elevation vineyard site known for its power and concentration. Sweet vanilla rides a dense wave of tannin and oak, finishing tight and leathery.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A special reserve from the producer's vineyard designate of Stagecoach, this wine is layered and full bodied in red licorice and generous oak. Soft, integrated tannins wrap around an herbal underscore that's further cradled in cherry and chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very deep color, unusually concentrated flavors and a thick blanket of tannins make this medium-bodied wine something to marvel at. It smells and tastes like black pepper, beef au jus, dark chocolate and blueberries, never gets too coarse, and has a long finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This attractive, delicate wine features gentle tannins and immediately accessible red-berry fruits. The structure is well integrated into the fruitiness of the wine. Acidity and a jammy strawberry aftertaste suggests this wine will be ready to drink soon. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is quite firm, but with plenty of black fruits under the severe exterior. Heavy losses from hail don't seem to have affected the ripeness and the structure of what will develop into a very fine wine. It offers spice and a touch of chocolate at the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of rich, ripe blackberry and cassis flavors in this dry, full-bodied Cabernet. It's quite scoury in youth, with strong, edgy tannins and a hit of zippy acidity. Give it 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years in the cellar to begin to calm down.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cool, earthy blackberry, cassis and boot-leather aromas are strapping and integrated. This feels layered and structured, with chewy depth, firm tannins and power. Baked, toasty, chocolaty flavors bring ripe-fruit notes of fig, prune and blackberry, while the finish is long and savory, with a strong accent of wood spice. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This hedonistically powerful mix of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot traffics in blackberry and black cherry jam over a layer of soft tannins. Coffee, toffee and subtle Asian and cinnamon spice keep the proceedings lively, for this is a seriously ripe and playful wine. Cellar through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a heritage site planted originally in 1859, this wine was made by Nils Venge and contains mostly Cabernet, with a small handful of Merlot and an even smaller pinch of Petit Verdot. Soft yet structured, it's layered in leathery dark-chocolate and black-fig tones, with juicy components of blackberry and cassis. It should age through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lovely notes of Golden Pearmain apple perfume the nose, with hints of soy sauce. The body and palate are luminous showing green apple freshness that come across as light, graceful and authentic. There is something honest and fresh-faced about this wine that is rather disarming. This is a very beautiful, classy cr\\u00c3\\u00a9mant made from a blend of Riesling and Auxerrois.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Jammy, rich and leathery, this full-bodied, robust wine has a touch of smoke lingering in the back, beneath soft, well-integrated oak. Juicy, it's enjoyable now, while being structured enough to go another decade or so. Cellar through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas recalling stewed plum, nutmeg, vanilla and a suggestion of blue flower. The ripe palate has a firm structure that supports dried black cherry, clove and aromatic herb while astringent tannins generate an abrupt, somewhat raspy finish. Give the tannins a few more years to mellow then drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas suggesting mature berry, baking spice, menthol, scorched earth and oak. The ripe palate offers stewed prune and bitter chocolate while assertive, tightly wound tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Menthol, leather and underbrush aromas lead the nose while the dense palate offers raw sour cherry and dried sage. Bracing tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This has aromas of ripe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094just shy of overripe\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094black fruit that recall plum preserves. The palate is rich, with flavors of mature black cherry, prune and chocolate bar. This lacks complexity and restraint, but is big, lush and decadent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bone-dry blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah is picking up aged notes, with the primary fruit flavors drying out. In its place are dried currants, cured meats, funky mushrooms. The tannins and acids provide firm structure. Already throwing some sediment, it will appeal to fans of older wines.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak completely overwhelms this wine. All you can smell and taste is char, caramel and wood spice, and the tannins, which are partly from oak barrels, are dense and hard. It's difficult even to discern any underlying fruit flavors, although if you try hard, you stumble across blackberries.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine delivers handsomely for the price, made in a style that embraces balanced herbaceousness and moderate ripeness. Sage, cedar and graphite accent a sizable underlying grip of tannin that should mellow with age and a vibrant layer of black fruit adding context.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy and brawny in pungent compost aromas, this wine has a citrus-laden edge of crisp mineral and bitterroot. Full-bodied and richly layered, its fruit components are dipped in baked rhubarb and black tea.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rose, underbrush, dried berry and balsamic notes lead the nose. The taut structured palate evokes juicy strawberry, crushed cherry, star anise and cake spice framed in tightly woven fine-grained tannins. It's elegant and well balanced, with fresh acidity.

There is fine fruit, plenty of acidity and a rich texture. It needs time, so drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dry and oaky, this Chardonnay offers herb-inflected pineapple and pear flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty scents of violet, rose, red berry, leather and forest floor rise from the glass along with a balsamic note. The palate offers crushed black cherry accented with notes of espresso, toast and sage. It has a tightly tannic, astringent finish. This will be better after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At 15% abv, this wine tastes frankly prickly and hot. It has luscious flavors of blackberries, red currants, mocha and oak, but that heat detracts from the enjoyment. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: High alcohol lends an uncomfortable heat to this blend of Syrah, Grenache and Viognier. Raspberry and cherry flavors are brightened by citrusy acidity. It's ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truffle, chopped mint, woodland berry and eucalyptus aromas unfold in the glass. Bright and juicy, the palate evokes succulent red berries, star anise, clove and tobacco, set against a backdrop of firm, polished tannins. Fresh acidity lends balance.

Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A subtle note of caramel adds richness to the baked apple aromas on the nose. On the palate, hints of chamomile tisane add to the baked apple flavors. The body is taut and linear. Rounded hints of baked apple persist even on the dry, clean and fresh finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A gentle lift of crushed black cherry rises from the glass. There also is an edge of medicinal herb. The body is light and juicy, fresh and highly aromatic. There is concentration without weight, luxuriant fruit without plumpness. This is fresh and pure, lifted and profound. An utterly honest and uplifting rendition of Pinot Noir.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautifully rich and rewarding expression of tropical fruit and creamy texture, this estate white spends nine months in large French oak casks and is selected from the best lots. Supporting acidity keeps it refreshing in waves of lime and grapefruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, dark spice, mature berry and balsamic notes emerge in the glass.

Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak. Thrills the mouth with decadently rich black currants, cr\\u00c3\\u00aame de cassis, milk chocolate, anise and cedar flavors, but never loses an impeccable sense of balance and control. Best now, even without decanting, and through 2014.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now. It's rich in black currant, cherry pie filling, plum, anise and spice flavors, generously aged in smoky new oak. Made in the modern style, it will hold effortlessly through 2012, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's an important new Cabernet that instantly takes its place in the increasingly crowded Napa pantheon. It's extraordinarily rich in black currants, chocolate, anise, pepper and cedar flavors that are wrapped into perfectly ripened tannins. Feels lush, plush and smooth in the mouth, and should age effortlessly for a decade or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a best barrels selection. It's the densest, most tannic of David Arthur's current releases, a massive wine stuffed with black currants, blackberries, anise, tobacco and smoky new oak. Best of all, it's dry, dry, dry. Fine now, if you're into young wines, but should age well in a good cellar for many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, powerful Bordeaux blend that clearly needs time. Tasted in early 2009, it's very tannic and dry, although you can detect the massive cassis and plum flavors. It would be a pity to open before 2012, if you can keep your hands off it. Could eventually stun. Alpha Omega is a winery to watch.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Outstanding for its purity, and the incredibly fine tannins, not to mention the compelling flavors. Black and red cherries, currants, cola, mushrooms, cedar, anise, and spice flavors mingle into a long, rich finish. So balanced and elegant. Made from 95% Sacrashe Vineyard fruit, in the Rutherford AVA.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The wine's beauty and intensity are impossible to match. There's enormous complexity of aromas here with chocolate, black tar, spice, blackberry, forest currant and tobacco. You'll pick up toasted oak tones as well, but they are carefully balanced within the naturally supple and smooth essence of this standout Brunello.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: All five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here, with 55% Cabernet Sauvignon leading the way. Red and black berries burst forth first, allowing for a juiciness on the palate, followed by tar, licorice and more blackberry. Balanced though full bodied, it finishes simply.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft layers of well-managed tannin and rocky minerality stand out in this older vintage, which has taken on secondary characteristics that suggest it may be nearly past its prime. Baked raisin bread comes into play the longer the wine is in the glass.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is classic Priorat from the opening gun. The nose is schisty on top, with molasses, spice, herb and stewed berry aromas below the surface. It's a spunky, racy wine with flavors of tomato, red plum, hard spice, pepper and tobacco, and the finish feels good and shows no detectable faults. Drink now; 80% Garnacha and 20% Carignan.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A luscious sweet wine, very honeyed and liquorous. As a complete contrast, the wine has that intense acidity that is the hallmark of Loire sweet wines. The combination is a fragrant nectar that will benefit from aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gone far away are the days when a Chinon normally clocked in at 12.5% alcohol. Now, as with this Clos de l'Echo, there is more power. Here, the power is put to good use, giving both a bold wine and one that has a sophisticated balance of firm, dry tannins and elegant black plum fruits. Age this wine for at least four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Flower petal, mineral and blackberry aromas solidify the bouquet on this excellent Tempranillo. The palate is big and chewy, with fine balance and driving flavors of cherry, plum, vanilla and oak resin. With a finish that's bone dry and focused, this Ribera wine is ready to drink but can last another 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years in a good cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tinges of saffron, pollen and hay lend a spicy, earthy undertone to this slick, honeyed ice wine. The palate is richly concentrated with sweet stone fruit and candied orange peel flavors bolstered by plush tangerine acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fruit is sourced from multiple sites, including Sangiacomo and Rancho Salina for this elegant wine which is slight in black and blue fruit with a subtle notion of leather. Structurally, it has a deep complexity of tannins that remains integrated on the back of the palate. It's ready for the table.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is firm and structured, with complex tannins and dark black-fruit flavors. Under the tannins, juicy fruit with considerable acidity gives signs of great potential. The aftertaste again comes back to the structure. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an outstanding wine with blockbuster appeal and penetrating aromas of vanilla, sweet spice and blackberry. The wine exhibits beautiful intensity and soft layers of creamy fudge, sip after delicious sip. The finish is bright and ripe with bursting red fruit. Drink in three to five years. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lots of voluptuous softness in the mouth, like velvet gliding over the palate. But you'll also experience serious tannins that hit midway, creating a lockdown astringency. Evidence of ageability lies in the massive core of blackberries and cassis, as well as the overall balance and tang of acidity on the finish. This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend should hit its stride after 2012 and continue for many years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Profile has been an important, but sometimes overlooked, member of the Napa Valley pantheon for many years, and their '06 shows why. It's a rich, complex and smooth wine. Packed with blackberry, cassis and smoky, new oak flavors, it shows a firm structure of tannins and acidity. Beautiful now with a grilled steak, and should age well for at least a decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fausoni is a rich and opulent Barbaresco that presents a veritable wall of flavors that surrounds you on all sides: Vanilla, sweet cherry and chocolate are the most obvious aromas, but Indian spice and black currants also make an appearance. Awesome intensity is followed by firm structure. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An enormously elegant, complex Pinot Noir that changes endlessly in the glass and is a joy to drink. Completely dry, and marked by silky tannins, it shows complicated cherry, rhubarb, pomegranate, cola, orange tea and sandalwood flavors. First class. Best now and for the next four or five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's one for the cellar. It's rich and ripe, yet the firm tannins and crisp acidity argue for time. Shows a complex heart of black cherries, red currants, cola, leather and smoky sandalwood that is frankly delicious. But the finish turns hard. Give it until 2011 to begin to show its stuff.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A gorgeous, Champagne-like sparkling wine. As good as the 2000, it's rich and silky, with a very fine mousse and rich citrus and yeast flavors. Needs time. Give it at least five or six years in the bottle, if you can keep your hands off.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bric Balin offers the same creamy succulence of Moccagatta's Cole Barbaresco, only here, you get added aromas of smoked bacon and cured meat. At the base is a solid foundation of lively fruit and chocolate-like nuances, and the wine ends with bold flavors and tight tannins. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a limited production 100% Cab from the winery's estate vineyard. It's much more tannic than Cohn's extraordinarily fine '04 Estate, which was released a year ago. Even at the age of five-plus, it stings with sandpapery astringency. Should easily negotiate the years, with its massive core of blackberries, black currants, olives and 100% new oak. Hold until after 2010, and should develop for many years beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This producer owns the coveted vineyard designation, selecting some fantastic fruit that yields a wine that is intense in black cherry and forest floor, accented by wild mushroom. The style is substantial and generous in ripeness and oak, mouthfillingly rich and lushly layered, yet elegant on the finish. Cellaring, through 2020, should soften its edges.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the trio of great white wine villages in the C\\u00c3\\u00b4te de Beaune, Puligny-Montrachet makes the most classical wines. This village wine has the best of all worlds with its generous fruit and beautifully taut texture. It's ready to drink but will also age well. Drink now and until 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of meat juice, scorched earth, grilled herb and dried plum lead the nose. On the rich palate, notes of licorice, dried sage, mocha and orange peel accent the primary flavors of raspberry jam and crushed black cherry. It's balanced with firm tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Curious hints of candied citrus peel, dried fig and apricot abound in this exotically spiced Riesling. Laced with honey and sweet apple flavors, it's off dry in style, yet impeccably balanced by a strike of spine-tingling acidity. While deft and dainty in mouthfeel, it finishes on a lingering cardamom note.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness. Clumsy now, but sometimes these wines improve in the long run. Try holding until after 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sparkling wine specialist Schramsberg ventures out to the Fort Ross area to tinker with Pinot Noir under its Davies brand. This shows intensity and concentration, with powerful raspberry and cherry essences that are compounded by sweet-tasting, smoky oak. Impressive now, but it should gain traction in the bottle over the next four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grapey and pinched on the nose, jammy smelling and unconvincing. Supernarrow in the mouth, tannic, lemony and sucks the life out of your cheeks and palate. And that's not even mentioning the price.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There are two levels of aroma to this blend of 49% Grenache, 34% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre and 17% Syrah: a bright floral touch and gravel-like minerality surround a deeper core of black currant and blueberry fruit. The palate is still quite tight, with elderberry, olallieberry and violet flavors, presented with a leathery texture. It shows lots of potential but still needs time.

The big chewy palate shows fleshy black cherry, chocolate and a hint of pipe tobacco while velvety tannins provide the framework. It's already approachable but will offer plenty of enjoyment for several years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vibrant and savory, this delivers wild cherry, dark raspberry, rosemary, mint and Mediterranean herb flavors alongside firm tannins. It closes on a licorice note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This syrupy, dense red exhibits tobacco and root beer flavors, framed with chunky tannins. Blackberry and black current fruit barely show through its leathery texture and profound weight.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opens with a thick amber color and aromas of peppermint, apricot, white mineral and lavender honey. There's a floral component in the mouth but this wine also offers distinctive flavors of dried grass or herbs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dusty mocha scents meet cedar and herb in this dense, full-bodied wine. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh on the palate, with a zing of clove, cinnamon and black pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Like so many wines from this site, this is explosive and powerfully rich, yet a lurking acidity keeps it fresh and in check. Notes of cedar, dried herb and pencil shavings meet integrated oak and firm tannin, as brambly blackberry and blueberry flavors linger with clove-tinged spice on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is round, while also having a mineral edge. Apple and wood flavors power through the crispness, along with a charming touch of honey. For short-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wine doesn't get much bigger than this. Bold and opulent, with a whopping 17% alcohol, this over-the-top bottling is aged in oak for two years and delivers masculine, chewy aromas of blackberry jam and Indian spice. Pair it with wedges of aged pecorino cheese.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth in tannins, rich and ripe in black cherry, mocha and spice flavors, and beautifully oaked, this Cabernet shows real elegance and style. It's a bit earthier and more abrupt than the modern style exemplified in neighboring Napa Valley, but still a fine wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots to like in this dry, silky Pinot Noir. Easy to imagine drinking it with a nice steak with mushrooms. It's rich in cherry, cola, mushroom and beef teriaki flavors. A little soft, and not an ager, but fine now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This celebration of legendary Jerry Lohr's 80th birthday is a winner on all fronts. A zesty, uplifting nose of blackberry, cola, licorice, leather and clay leads into a cohesively woven palate of soy, shiitake dust, roast beef and dark chocolate. The acidity is well-measured, the tannins are chalky and grippy and it's powerful without being flashy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an inaugural release from this site, an ocean-viewing, high-elevation perch overlooking the Pacific Ocean that loves the variety.

The elegant, structured palate delivers ripe black cherry, cinnamon, anise and tobacco while firm, polished tannins provide support and finesse. A blast of orange zest signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, tough and totally dry, this has blackberry and currant flavors.

It has enormous concentration of sweet, ripe white and yellow fruits, balanced by the sharp cut of acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Perfumed, floral and ageworthy, this combines a taut texture with a toast note, showing great depth of flavor. The line of pure green and white fruit is very apparent. On the finish, bright acidity matches the great fruitiness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The winery has been producing this bottling for many years, and this is possibly the finest ever.

Best yet, the fruit is young enough to promise more years of graceful aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vines here have produced a 2009 that is hugely ripe, rounded and concentrated. With its sweet wood and vanilla flavors, with balancing apple and apricot fruits, it's a wine for pleasure soon, but it will also age.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: It's rare in Burgundy that a producer can add his name to a vineyard, but Faiveley's tradition goes back at least a century. This is huge and dense; the notes of spice, sweet black plum and acidity are all comfortably balanced with the powerful tannic structure. This needs at least seven years of aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged in French oak puncheons, this youthful, citrusy, big and smoky wine seems to flicker in and out\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094like an old movie\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094with each sip revealing a different view of the landscape.

It's completely dry and rich in blackberries, black currants, baking chocolate, anise and minerals. It feels dramatic from the start, like the opening notes of a great symphony or rock song. Cellar it for at least eight years, and it could age well beyond that.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is built to impress through its sheer power. With a little Petit Verdot blended in, which adds a floral character, it's marked by an intense flavor of ripe wild blackberries, with a dried berry quality that's suggestive of currants and a liqueur fullness, courtesy of the high alcohol. The French oak is a full 100% new, and is in keeping with the wine's volume. So rich and tannic now, it's barely drinkable. Give it at least 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years in a good cellar and see what happens.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firm and closed, this shows both richness and minerality.

Flavors of tropical fruit and peach create an opulent and generous feel, with notes from having aged in wood offering complexity. It's concentrated and ageworthy, worth keeping for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years and more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a modern, plump rendition of Amarone, with soft lines and chewy aromas of black cherry, chocolate fudge, cinnamon and blackberry preserves that are immediate and upfront. The rich, velvety texture make this a great candidate for pairing with wintery cheese fondue.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A fairly new player on the Napa Valley scene, this uses the talents of winemakers Cary Gott and Philippe Melka. The wine opens in luxurious aromas of baked blackberry cobbler and spicy cinnamon-clove. Mouthfillingly generous in fruit and texture, it's soft and approachable, serving as a nice representative of the vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a robust, dense and tannic wine, with 8% each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec. It needs time to unravel what are now just mere suggestions of coffee and black-cherry jam, with seasonings of cedar, peppercorn and dried sage. Full bodied, ripe and highly structured, this should be enjoyed in years to come, through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opaque and thick in color, this bombastically powerful and concentrated wine has pruney sweetness lurking on the back palate, softened by sprinkles of vanilla and black pepper atop a sturdy helping of blackberry pie.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With mild red fruit, baked plum accents and a lackluster structure, this wine, blended with 10% Merlot, is big and dense.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A small percentage of Petit Verdot was added to this Cab, the grapes sourced from throughout the Napa Valley. Cedar, mint and chocolate cassis come foreward on the palate, the wine slightly thin though oaky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 2003 Barbaresco is evolving well, if quickly. It shows mature flavors of smoky fruit, sweet plums, graphite and a touch of rubber. Soft on the palate, and delicious now, it should drink well for another five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tough and resilient in acids and tannins, but elegantly streamlined. Shows tart flavors of sour red cherry candy, vanilla and sweet sandalwood. Now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932014.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The tannins are still hard as nails in this five-year-old Cabernet. It's like chewing on sandpaper, but the black currant and cassis flavors are powerful. An old-fashioned wine that could develop over the years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Herb, cherry, wood spice and vanilla aromas are followed by cherry and blackberry flavors backed by a squeeze of dry tannins. There are good things going on but the oak gets a bit up front.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's menthol, new leather, toast, eucalyptus and exotic spice aromas lift from the glass. The firm palate shows dried cherry, pomegranate, chopped sage and roasted coffee bean flavors while grainy tannins lend a raspy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dusty, peachy aromas are mellow, while overall not a lot is happening on the nose. A somewhat collapsed, fallen palate is ultimately a bit flat. Mild apple and spice flavors last on a finish that's slightly bitter and tastes of almond.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a soft wine with red-berry fruits and only light acidity. Its tannins and perfumed fruitiness are now mature. The aftertaste is elegant and easy. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Apricot and peach fruits dominate this creamy, soft wine. It's smooth, lightly toasty and ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A light, clear color suggests a lighthearted wine, but this coastal vineyard-designate delivers plenty of power around a core of damp, earthy wild strawberry and blackberry. Soft, with managed and integrated tannins, it's relatively high in acidity and is well structured, with a pleasant jamminess and aromas of freshly cut rose.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep and dark blueberry aromas are laced with blackberry-balsamic reduction, black tobacco, black sage and a brooding spice character on this blend of 71% Syrah, 24% Grenache and 5% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre. It's thick and chewy on the palate, with ripe purple fruits clinging to a dense backbone of bacon fat and fudge.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy, soft and sublime, this vineyard site sits on the extreme Sonoma Coast, near the town of Annapolis, approaching the Mendocino County line. Fine tannins and bright acidity combine for a memorable taste experience, marked in fresh strawberry, raspberry and black pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With hard tannins, sharp acids and dry, somewhat austere mouthfeel, this wine, blended with a drop of Malbec, distinguishes itself for its complexity. Blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and espresso flavors combine for interest. Yet the wine doesn't seem to be an ager. It needs rich, fatty meats and cheeses to balance the astringency.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Still so young, the wine is tight at this stage.

Power and structure as well as a smoky character from 50% new wood aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Firm and solid with great swathes of black fruits as well as dense tannins. Ripe fruits are a major element of this concentrated wine. The wine has power and a firm tannic core, and certainly needs aging for seven years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The sunny 2007 vintage and the well exposed Bricco Pernice cru make a formidable team and drive the momentum and intensity of this beautiful Barolo. The wine is rich and penetrating with an ever-evolving bouquet of dark berry fruit, spice, licorice, bitter chocolate and rum cake. The wine shows firm but round tannins with loads of dark fruit on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big and rich, this is a broad, open version of Corton-Charlemagne, a powerhouse of ripe white and yellow fruits. It seems initially without enough depth, a product of its youth, then gradually the ripe structure shows through, promising aging over 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00937 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a wonderful wine that has the dry complexity and tannic structure of a great Napa red, with rich layers of cherries, red currants, mocha and sweet smoky oak. Yet it's supple, with a deft drinkability. A brilliant interpretation of the variety, it's hard to keep from popping the cork now, but should age well for 8\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The soft voluptuousness of this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux blend is its most evident feature. It has plenty of staunch tannins, but they're as finely woven as a silk tapestry, while the flavors are dazzling, suggesting black cherries, red currants and hints of dark chocolate and anise.

Black fruits give way to a dry, firm end, promising considerable aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine has a gamy character with spicy tannins. It is rich and succulent with black fruits, but has an earthy texture and is solid and powerful. It brings out both the terroir and the potential richness of a Volnay. For aging over seven years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Elvio Cogno and his family take great care to render an individual identity to each of the various vineyard crus they farm. Vigna Elena displays a particularly elegant and fine expression of Nebbiolo with dark fruit and blackberry followed by bright licorice, tar and cola. The tannins are tight and firm and the mouthfeel is incredibly polished and long. Hold 10 to 15 more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll love that extra fruity richness that this beautiful Barolo from the warm 2007 vintage proudly puts on display. Black fruit and plum is backed by licorice, cola, tar and a drying mineral sensation. The tannins are firm but polished and the wine promises a 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009320 year drinking window.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rocca's most expensive wine is 100% Cabernet, although it doesn't say so on the label. It's very rich and flamboyant, offering waves of blackberries and cassis liqueur. 100% new French oak shows up, but it's in keeping with the wine's volume. With massive tannins and brilliant balance, there's no reason this shouldn't age for a long time.

The palate is velvety in feel, putting a focus on elegance. It shows plenty of hang time on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a spicy, vibrantly realized wine from a coastal ridge five miles from the Pacific Ocean dusted in sandy, loam soils. It's planted entirely to the Swan clone, which can contribute an undeniable wildness to the variety. Baked cherry meets spearmint and clove, the acidity light and bright with plenty of texture atop the medium-sized body.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre (45%), Grenache (31%) and Syrah (12%) make up the majority of this wine, which is fleshed out with Counoise, Grenache Blanc and Picpoul. Vibrant aromas of cracked pepper, raspberry, underbrush, dried violets, smoked meat and herb are followed by elegant yet still flavorful fruit and savory notes that show a pleasing tartness and generous mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas that recall moist underbrush, grilled sage, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor. The brisk, diluted palate offers raw red cherry, oak and a hint of star anise alongside stinging acidity and astringent tannins that leave a raspy finish. It lacks fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A delicate wine that is completely ready to drink and needs to be consumed now before it ages further. The fruit has developed a secondary, animal character, the tannins starting to dominate with their dryness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by strong, ripe fruit, this Cab is a bit one-dimensional. It offers waves of blackberries, cherries, raspberries and chocolate, with a rich coating of sweet, smoky oak, and has a soft, melted mouthfeel. Seems at its best now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a serious wine with a lighter brighter side. Its wood aging adds spice to the ripe red fruits and brings out the concentration and intensity.

There are ripe fruit aromas, meaty notes of beef jerky and ethereal tones of licorice and cola.

Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a well-integrated super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, although the 2005 vintage doesn't have quite the same intensity as 2004.

The black fruits are rich from the vintage, warm and jammy. This is a wine with fine concentration, coming into balance, finishing with black currant acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a silly name, and it's not a very good wine.

Yet there's something going on. As the wine warms in the glass it becomes richer, showing hidden pineapple tart, macadamia and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9e. Firm, minerally acidity is there throughout, making for a mouthwatering cleanliness.

The palate is framed by extremely strong, hard-to-cut tannins, which hold burned flavors of black coffee and charred berries.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is still young and closed, but pretty aromas of rose, perfumed berry, baking spice and menthol eventually emerge. The palate delivers crunchy red cherry, raspberry, white pepper, anise and a balsamic note alongside austere but fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. Give it time to open up and develop complexity. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas include ripe black fruit, spice, savory herb and a balsamic note. The tight palate offers black raspberry, crushed blackberry, menthol and sage alongside a firmly tannic backbone. A licorice note signals the finish. It's still young and a little astringent on the close. Drink after 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One whiff tells you this bubbly is in a league of its own. It\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s not the toast or the lees, not the lime-scented fruit or the doughy notes; it\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s something indefinable, but complex and refined. That pedigree carries through in the mouth, where the fruit is modulated. The impression is of acidity and elegance, although the fruit shows up in the finish. Terrific now, but has the balance and harmony to last for a lot longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This dark and brawny wine opens with savory notes of black pepper and cured meat backed by prune and dried currants. The wine has aged well and shows bright acidity on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak spice and dark chocolate are balanced nicely against dried fruit, cassis and sour cherry. The various aromatic elements are measured and integrated to form a wine that promises steady evolution in the future. That impression is reinforced by the wine's structure and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brunello Il Marroneto offers a touch of ripeness in the form of cherry fruit, vanilla cream, cinnamon and caramel. Sharp acidity in the backdrop definitely puts all that soft roundness into perspective. The wine is etched, austere and firmly structured.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: La Mannella offers an opulent, modern wine with ripe aromas of black cherry, leather, rum cake and black licorice. The wine is tight and astringent in the mouth with sharp endnotes of sour cherry and bright acidity. Its natural density stands up to the freshness and the whole package works as a whole.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Candied cherry, fruit liqueur, caramel, licorice and dark chocolate open the bouquet of this beautiful riserva from Montalcino. The wine is lean and bright on the close with fresh acidity and bright cherry notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Poggio Antico is one of the best estates in Montalcino but the 2008 vintage doesn't reach the impressive heights of 2006 or 2007 that showed much fuller and more generous results. This edition offers plum, wild berry and leather aromas with a lean mouthfeel and sharp acidity that will soften with a few more years of bottle aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe, full-throttle wine. It has layers of blackberry and firm, dusty tannins. They are balanced by the juicy texture that gives the wine both freshness and the promise of some further aging. The wine is complex, rich and with good potential. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tight and tannic, this opens with aromas of Amaretto, ripe berry, Alpine herb and a balsamic note. The firm palate offers black cherry, licorice, white pepper and cherries marinated in spirits. Firm but refined tannins provide structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe red berry, fragrant blue flower, cake spice, menthol and an earthy hint of truffle emerge in the glass. The juicy palate offers fleshy cherry, raspberry, licorice and chopped mint alongside firm, velvety tannins.

The firm, concentrated palate offers tart cherry, licorice and ground clove alongside a backbone of bracing tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Though reserved on the nose at first, this bottling begins to show dense blueberry, coffee and soy with patience. There are boisterous flavors of squeezed elderberry and blackberry fruit once sipped, along with beef char, black coffee, dark chocolate and purple flowers on the finish. This still needs a little time to open, but shows lots of potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola, this offers notes of rich chocolate fudge, cherry, blackberry, spice and tobacco. It offers firm but velvety tannins, with a long, fresh endnote of ripe berry fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage of Deliella represents an enormous jump forward in quality and intensity. Nero d'Avola vines grow in chalky soils, create extremely elegant aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, cured meat, toasted pistachio and barbecue spice. In the mouth, the wine is rich, velvety and long lasting.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is made in the smooth, oaky and rich style of the modern cult Cabernet. It offers lots of ripe, jammy blackberries, plus notes of sweet, intense black and red currants, dark chocolate tart, black licorice and smoky oak. The tannins are tough but structured, so give it six years in the cellar and see what happens.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite the high alcohol level, this is classic Bordeaux, with style, elegance and fine balance between tannin and ripe black-currant fruit. It demonstrates the concentration and rich structure of the vintage, yet the finish has a light, bright, fruity touch.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This firmly structured wine is packed with solid tannins as well as ripe juicy red fruits.

Dense and needing to age, the wine will be ready from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and rounded with a creamy texture, this wine is ripe with apricots and has a strongly mineral character. Full of fruit, the wine also has a texture that means it needs to age. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Among the most northerly of the run of Beaune premier crus, the wine is structured but the structure is cushioned by the ripe red-berry fruits to give a generous wine. Backed by tannins, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A firmly structured wine, solid with tannins and with structure. The wine is also full of fruit potential, ripe with red berries. It is dense wine that needs to age. Drink from 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a structured wine, dark and firm as tannins meld with the ripe berry fruits. It has the weight to have great potential. The wine, with its concentration and dense tannins, will be ready to drink from 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe generous wine with soft tannins and already delicious red fruits. It lives up to the ideal of Volnay, rich and sumptuous, although with an attractive cut of acidity to balance. Drink this wine from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Grenache (53%), Cabernet Sauvignon (34%) and Syrah (13%) explodes with potpourri, peat, white pepper, smoke and earth aromas. The palate is loaded with fruit and savory flavors that glide into the extended finish. The texture is absolutely dazzling.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a cool wine, with acidity and citrus fruits well in evidence. It comes from one of the higher premier-cru vineyards, giving a crisp and textured wine even in this warm vintage. It needs time.

With lively acidity, this wine will age well. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wood-aged and structured wine is concentrated and dense. It comes from the Premier Cru vineyard just to the west of the village. With generous tannins and juicy ripe red fruits, the wine is broad and going to be rich. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This classic Barolo reveals ripe dark fruit and earth aromas, and hints of orange peel and herbs. The palate is still closed, but you can detect ripe fruit, spice and mint notes. It has bracing but fine tannins, and promises to open up in a few more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This classic Barolo is fermented with wild yeasts. The fragrance is earthy and floral, suggesting truffle, leather and ripe berry. The palate delivers ripe wild cherries and herbs, and reflecting the vintage, this is already forward and enjoyable now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard Barbaresco offers underbrush and tobacco leaf aromas layered with toast, espresso and oak. The palate is succulent, featuring black cherry, licorice, spice and eucalyptus notes. Nicely balanced, but still young and aggressive; best after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet is enormously extracted in blackberries and cassis, and oaky, too, while the tannins are rich, hard and refined. It's a flashy wine. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This straightforward Barolo offers classic Nebbiolo aromas of dried rose petal, forest floor and ripe cherry. The palate delivers bright cherry and berry flavors, with hints of balsamic herbs and a subtle layer of carob. This is still young and tannic, but has surprising freshness for the vintage. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Firmly tannic and rather mouth-numbing even at five years of age. Enters with a hard edge and finishes tough and gritty. Will it age? There are some black cherry flavors inside, but it's a gamble.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A selection of the better barrels from the Home Ranch, the Reserve is fantastically rich and complex. No mere fruit bomb despite scads of flavors ranging from apples and peaches through pears and mangoes, there's also a sleek backbone of steel, all of it wrapped in a rich, honeyed texture. The finish is long and intricately constructed of dusty brown spices.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This dense and dark wine is full of ripe, richly juicy black fruits. Solid tannins and layers of wood are softening into the rest of the wine. It's going to develop slowly, releasing the fruit into the tannic structure. Wait until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a famed old site planted to 75% Zinfandel and 25% mixed black-skinned varieties, this wine conveys a minty-eucalyptus quality that tunes the acidity high against a medium-weight body. Austere at first on the palate, it expands as it goes, offering robust, dry tannins and layers of cardamom and coffee with time and air.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Side-by-side, Sheldrake Point's two Riesling ice wines are a fascinating study of how yeast affects flavors in wine. This regular-label ice wine, fermented with inoculated yeast, has a sunny, sweet charm. Notes of pressed apple, warming spice and potpourri perfume lend a cider-like tone. The palate lingers, countering bright, lemony acidity with a long peach kiss.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The winery blends 84% Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec for this high-end red. Burly in tobacco and cedar, it also offers a floral, high-toned spirit built around juicy cranberry on the palate. With well-integrated tannins and oak, it finishes in a note of bittersweet chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy aromas of truffle, leather, scorched earth, game and a balsamic note lead the nose. The brawny, monolithic palate delivers ripe red berry, steeped plum, licorice and a confectionary note alongside chewy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Powerful wine, structured with apple skin tannins, layers of ripe, spicy toast and a taut, mineral character. There is something of the Meursault richness here, in the full white fruit flavors, but this is also a wine that needs to age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very pretty blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet with well-defined notes of black cherry, leather, tobacco, chocolate, bramble and maple syrup. Recognizable oak renderings establish a refined and sophisticated feel and offer background notes of toasted nut and spice. The wine delivers fresh berry flavors, tight tannins and cool freshness on the finish. Drink after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Super-fruity, with intensely concentrated blackberries, cassis and milk chocolate, while the oak is very heavy in sweet caramel and buttered toast. Not showing much now beyond sheer power. Could develop, but it's risky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intensely floral aromas of violet and iris lead the nose along with a whiff of menthol. The one-dimensional palate offers black cherry, cranberry and licorice alongside bright acidity and fine-grained tannins. Despite the hint of evident alcohol on the finish, this is surprisingly easy drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a Cabernet Sauvignon from northern Italy that shows some budding tertiary aromas of polished stone and black licorice now six years after the harvest. You'll also get black fruit, tar and simple, polished tannins on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggesting mature berry, dried herb, scorched soil and espresso lead the nose. The medium-bodied palate is already evolved, offering prune, dried black cherry, mocha and a hint of licorice alongside soft acidity and fine-grained tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark skinned berry, exotic spice, French oak and crushed blue flower aromas unfold on this. The firm palate displays dried red cherry, coffee, mint and toasted oak but it doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to balance the oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An aromatically subtle wine with notes of mortared herbs, flowers and cherry. The fruit flavors are elegantly styled, broadening with time, with a slightly gritty feel to the tannins but with a long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has aromas of wood, vanilla and toast. The palate is already evolved and tired, and it lacks the fruit richness to carry off the oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich blackberry pur\\u00c3\\u00a9e, blueberry jam, raspberry pie, cherry tart and cedar flavors in this Cab. Rather direct in its appeal, and a bit too sweet, but its solid New World style will appeal to some.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (65%), Merlot and Sangiovese is tad jammy and cooked. The wine delivers tight, tart tannins with impressive structure and length.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From 40-year-old vines, this Brunello opens with French oak, coconut, spiced plum and balsamic eucalyptus notes. Those aromas carry over to the palate, which is assertive and chewy with licorice and espresso flavor. A backbone of close-grained tannins provides support.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and star anise set the tone of this full-bodied red. The palate is juicy and polished, full of ripe black cherry, tobacco, clove and tangerine zest flavors, ribbed with fine-grained tannins.

The full-bodied yet one-dimensional palate delivers wild cherry, black raspberry, star anise and salty mineral notes made bolder by alcohol warmth and big, velvety tannins. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This juicy all-Merlot bottling boasts blackberry and green peppercorn aromas. The firm palate doles out black currant, tobacco, clove and licorice flavors, framed by crunchy tannins. Enjoy through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark spice, forest floor, sun-baked soil and toast aromas lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate doles out raspberry jam, vanilla, licorice and espresso notes, while close-grained tannins provide firm support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of four vineyards, this is an extremely impressive Merlot. It dazzles with rich, ripe black currant, cherry liqueur, raspberry, milk chocolate, smoky oak and spice flavors that are complex and go on and on through the finish. Beyond that is the texture, so refined and elegant, combining power and subtle elegance. Just a gorgeous, sensual Merlot. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The grapes come from three vineyards: Georges III in Rutherford, Tokalon in Oakville and Stagecoach, up on Atlas Peak. That helps explain the wine's beauty. It's pure California, cult-style Cab, soft and generous, with voluptuously ripe black currant and black cherry flavors elaborately enriched with spicy, smoky, 100% new French oak. My only quibble is that it could use a little more subtlety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very good wine, rich and packed with flavor. A dry and softly tannic, it floods the mouth with cassis, red currant, blueberry, plum, cocoa and smoky oak flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright and fruity with touches of wood, this is a complex wine with good acidity, a crisp texture and a strong mineral strain. It is rich and will age well. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, menthol, dark fruit, violet and a note of exotic spice take shape in the glass. The chewy palate delivers ripe cherry, pomegranate, white pepper, herb and a truffle note while fine-grained tannins provide support and polish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There are dark tannins here, although they are embedded in the ripe black fruits. This wine is solid and firm, the acidity giving the essential freshness. The fruitiness and the plush texture are taking their time to show. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Perfumed and juicy, this is already an attractive wine. Fine tannins and plenty of red fruits give a fresh and structured character. With a firmer background, it will develop well. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of rose, iris, berry and leather lift out of the glass.

An anise note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toast, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and woodland berry aromas lead the way.

The ripe, delicious palate doles out crushed raspberry, juicy Marasca cherry, white pepper and espresso alongside a tannic backbone. A tobacco note wraps around the finish. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a hearty version of the variety for this producer, known for its oft-lighter approach. It reveals skill as well, the grapes from another prime site overseen by brand partner Bill Price. A feral shock of mushroom dominates on the nose before punchy tannins and a medium-body distract slightly in contoured texture, only barely letting in crisp flavors of orange peel and dark cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged in Slavonian casks, this opens with classic Nebbiolo aromas of rose, violet, perfumed berry and baking spice. The juicy palate doles out ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry, licorice and white pepper while fresh acidity and firm, velvety tannins provide balance. It's already approachable but hold for more complexity. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toast, mocha, dark berry, roasted herb and scorched soil slowly come together.

The palate shows structure and some aging potential, offering dried black cherry, tobacco, clove and cinnamon alongside assertive tannins that leave a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Temecula vintner Phil Baily is one of this warmer region's strongest proponents for upholding complexity over ripeness. This bottling offers red currant, cedar, leather and minty chocolate on the nose, while the palate conveys lots of herbal influence, from peppercorn, licorice and dill to minty black raspberry and eucalyptus oil. All those elements need more time to integrate. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Foursquare, almost chunky, the tannins dominate black fruits, dark chocolate and spice flavors. There is considerable concentration here, along with initial high acidity. Straight from bottling, the fruit is subdued. The weight of the wine, though, confirms that this is going to be a powerhouse.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From the distant 1994 vintage, this Vin Santo blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia has been aged an astonishing 15 years in small oak barrel. You can detect some of that evolution on the bouquet thanks to aromas of dried apricot, marron glac\\u00c3\\u00a9, maple syrup and candied fruit with cinnamon spice. It's a sweet, thick wine with great intensity and the potential to age many more years to come.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A stunningly good, young Cabernet, marked by rich, ripe flavors of blackberries, black currant and cedar flavors, wrapped into strong but fine tannins. Lovely and sweet now, with some decanting, and should develop bottle complexity over the next 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Syrah, this has a restrained nose that reveals baking spice and licorice aromas as it opens. The palate is more assertive, offering clove, ground black pepper and powdered sage notes, with raspy tannins that leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Veins of sweet cinnamon and chocolate run through the body of this thick, concentrated wine. Exceedingly soft and supple, it has penetrating endnotes of cherry preserves, blackberry pie and Middle Eastern spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's a little high in alcohol and astringently tannic, but it has deep flavors of red- and black-fruit liqueurs and new oak. It's a heady wine that would pair well with robust fare.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers savory tones of smoked bacon, cured meat, licorice, candied fruit and leather. The finish is very smooth, long and polished.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: If you like power, this is the wine you want. The heat from the alcohol is definitely noticeable, but it's also nicely balanced by the thick extraction, soft texture and ripe berry flavors. High alcohol is a common result of the appassimento process (the air-drying of grapes) used to make this wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bit hot and heavy, lacking the freshness you want in a new-release Pinot Noir. The flavors are of cherries and blackberries baked into a pie that got a little overcooked.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rich, concentrated wine, with generous fruits and soft tannins. It has super-ripe black plums, a touch of chocolate and spice from wood aging. Powerful, juicy, fruity, likely to age well over the medium-term, over the next 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Just under five years in age, this wine's Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant profile shows through its full-bodied mouthfeel, dense tannins and cassis flavor. It's a big, new-oaky wine that's forward with concentrated fruit through the finish. A bit of a show-off now, it should benefit from 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Trine, named for the three main partners at Pepper Bridge winery, is predominantly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a final 12% of the blend divvied up among the other three Bordeaux red grapes. It shows good balance and complexity, phenolic ripeness, texture and herbal detail. But despite so many good traits, it has less concentration than most wines in its price category.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Produced at Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau Haut-Bailly, this concentrated red show the attractive fruit of 2011. It's tannins are relatively gentle, a fine counter-point to the red berry and currant fruits. It's a wine for medium-term aging over the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and smooth, this is a good example of the sumptuous 2009 vintage. It is soft, ripe with blackberry and red plum fruits. It is already developing well. It's a medium-term wine, already juicy and drinkable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An unexpected touch of caramel butterscotch or candied fruit could indicate very mild oxidation although the jury is still out. Otherwise, the wine does a good job of presenting austere aromas of old spice, worn leather and dried fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Il Palazzone offers a compact, streamlined interpretation of Brunello with a bright ruby color and crispness that helps keep the palate refreshed sip after sip. It offers lingering tones of black licorice, cola, mature fruit, cassis and dried raspberry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A good, strong, sturdy wine, filled with classic blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors. It's dry and rich, but the tannins are aggressive. They're edgy and tough and off-putting. It may be the kind of old-fashioned wine that comes around after 10 or 15 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, ripe berry, sage and a whiff of citrus zest. On the palate, white pepper and coconut back up the core of dried cherry alongside astringent tannins, but it lacks fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured blend of Nero d'Avola, Petit Verdot, Syrah and a small percentage of other grape varieties offers cassis, mocha and underbrush aromas. The dense palate doles out prune, carob, licorice and pipe tobacco notes alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This juicy coastal wine offers medium acidity and a lightness on the palate. It is a well-crafted, balanced effort, exuding wet stone, lemon zest, apple and white flower aromas and flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A toasty wood-smoke aroma meets firm, vivid and rather tart fruit flavors in this medium-bodied, elegant and cerebral wine. It has firm structure and good balance, as fine-grained tannins and tangy acidity support the red-cherry and raspberry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is packed tightly with candied fruit, cassis, tar, licorice and dark caramel notes. It shows its age and probably should be consumed within the next year or two. The palate offers a clean, polished feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dusty peppercorn and a green note of cedar define this simple, somewhat diluted effort that's light bodied and lacking in complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich, opulent Cabernet, made in the modern style. It's firm in tannins and dense with blackberry, currant, olive, dark chocolate and new oak flavors, but is really too young to drink now. Give it at least 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon (37%) and Cabernet Franc (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance Merlot (16%), Malbec (8%) and Petit Verdot. The aromas are quite locked up, with light notes of barrel spice, herb and assorted dark fruit. The palate has light tightly coiled fruit flavors. It needs time to reveal its charms. Best after 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Named for the producer's farmhouse and its surrounding vineyard, this offers rich cherry cordial and weedy sage notes\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a seamless mix of fruit and earth. Sage, cardamom and spicy white pepper flavors give it intrigue and complexity, wrapped in a thick, velvety texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In 2011 the alcohol drops a bit and the fruit comes forward, stepping slightly away from the strongly herbal flavors of the 2010. It's reflective of the vintage, and perhaps more immediately approachable, without sacrificing any of the complexity or structure that typifies Gramercy wines. Strongly aromatic flavors of blackberry, black cherry, cola and licorice are all in play, backed with refreshing minerality. The wine should age beautifully for a decade or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is massively ripe, with black currant, dark chocolate and anise flavors.

No reason to age this puppy, so drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the two luxury wines from Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau d'Esclans, Les Clans is rich, wood-aged and full of ripe and rounded fruit flavors. With the extra year of aging, it has lost some initial freshness but has gained complexity and structure. The wine is full-bodied while remaining very stylish. Drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is certainly dramatic in structure, akin to a young Pauillac from Bordeaux, with concentrated currant, cherry, pencil lead and cedar flavors wrapped into youthfully hard tannins. It needs time, and should soften with increased complexity by 2009. Could reward with even longer cellaring, but '04 was not a great vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A lush Cabernet that feels soft and delicious right now, but has layers of complexity that make it a cellar candidate. Dry and oaky, the wine is enormously rich in blackberry, cassis, cocoa and cedar flavors, with considerable tannins. The wine is wonderfully balanced. Drink now through 2010, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows the precision and control of Smith's previous Maritime Pinot, marked by a tense, exciting structure. Crisp acids and fine, dusty tannins dance with earthy cherry and cola fruit, herbs and oak to create a complex, tremendously rewarding palate experience. Best now through 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Rutherford vineyard has been the source of well-regarded Cabs for Monticello and the '04 is the latest. Compact and ageworthy, it shows well-ripened blackberry, cherry and cola flavors that have been generously oaked. The tannins are firm and sticky now, suggesting development. Best 2008\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932012.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093especially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very opulent, very rich, this is a complex, structured wine packed with fruit and brooding tannins. It is already rich, and will develop into a beautifully intense, concentrated and generous wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A sumptuous wine, rich in bright red fruits, with a structure and depth of flavor to match. The wine is gorgeously ripe, opening its heart quickly. Acidity, bitter chocolate and dark cherries go with the tannic core to promise long aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an exceptional wine that will leave a mark, and a memory, with those who drink it. It's irresistible because of its brilliant, but simple, philosophy. Traditional Nebbiolo tones of cola, licorice and pressed violets are set beautifully against modern tones of spice, chocolate and vanilla. It's the integration of these two extremes that make this Barolo so important.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A structured wine, with great density of fruit, richness of  texture and at the same time acidity. Its black fruit and red berry flavors are pure and very linear while also giving the wine a full-bodied character.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The grandest of all white Burgundy vineyards, Montrachet has produced a powerful, great wine, with impressive ripe, dense fruit. There is still elegance, a sense of proportion, but the opulence of the Chardonnay here is impossible to resist.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A powerful, classic Chambertin, intensely structured and tannic. The sweet black fruit is potentially enormous, still finding its place among the tannins. Spice, with a mineral streak, gives the wine added complexity. Very dense in texture, this will age 10 years and many more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A very rich wine, showing all the opulence of 2009. Black plums, damsons and wood flavors are already combined and integrated. The acidity in all this richness and power seems low, leaving the tannins to support aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Almost over the top, this beautiful Barolo from the most celebrated cru of them all\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the iconic Cannubi vineyard\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094delivers maximum pleasure and intensity. This is a soft and velvety wine, with cherry, cassis, leather, moist tobacco and licorice aromas over extracted concentration and tight tannins. The wine needs more time to age and once it does, it can be paired with beef or aged cheeses.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pio Cesare and the 2007 vintage marry beautifully to produce a layered, opulent, textured, rich wine that is bursting with zesty red fruit, sassy spice, leather and toasted espresso bean. What really sets this wine apart is the dense smoothness of its texture. Save this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe, dark berry, mocha, toast and a whiff of clove lead the nose. The forward palate offers ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, vanilla, light oak, coconut and coffee alongside close-grained tannins. A mint note closes the finish. This is straightforward and already accessible so enjoy 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Three things characterize this wine: exceptionally intense blackberry and currant flavors, thick, hard tannins and a bone dry finish. It's big and firm with a lot of promise, so do try to cellar it for at least six years, but people who like their wines young could try it sooner.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine that reveals a textured side of Meursault. It has weight, ripe apricot and pineapple fruit with a refreshing touch of acidity. But the chalky, mineral character equally defines the wine. Age for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The largely unexplored Faro denomination in the northern point of Sicily is producing some of the island's best work. The promising Nocera grape variety is used here and vintner Salvatore Geraci is one of its biggest proponents. This blended red is finely embroidered with subtle notes of forest berry, cassis, leather and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aurielle's Cabernets have been consistent over the years, offering lots of ripe, modern-style blackberry, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors in a wine that's drinkable now. This '08 is quite stylish and elegant despite the power, with near-perfect tannins. You could age it, but it's really best enjoyed for flashy, youthful richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the darkest, biggest, richest of Raymond's 2007 Cabernets. It's ripe and full in blackberries and currants, with a thick coating of sweet, toasty oak, but it's not really drinkable now because the tannins are so strong. Designed for the cellar, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009312 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an intriguing wine, with notes of dried sage, fresh herbs, mineral and black tea. The palate offers sweet, dense, layered vanilla, clove and cherry flavors backed by dry tannins. Still young, this wine needs extended time in the cellar to be properly appreciated. Best after 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of violet, ripe berry, orange zest, toasted oak and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The structured palate offers mature cherry, white pepper, licorice, well-integrated oak spices, vanilla and grilled sage alongside firm, polished tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's a bit warm on the midpalate but it still retains finesse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light in body for a Napa Cab but extremely elegant, this polished wine is fully ready to drink now. A blend of Oakville and Calistoga fruit, it's rich in cherry, red and black currant and Dr. Pepper flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Defines the Paso Robles style of enormously ripe fruit and softness. Incredibly rich in brown sugar, blackberry jam, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, it's not particularly subtle, but delicious now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Weedy underbrush and scorched soil aromas lead the way along with a smoked note. The bitter palate offers a green note of powdered sage and hazelnut but it lacks fruit. Clenching tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blends 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot into a tightly woven package of red fruit, soft tannin and robust concentration. Full bodied, it shows the warmth and distinct power of the vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An iconic wine, this shows bold spice and smoke flavors that are brushed over a core of dark, luscious fruit. It's already soft and plush with a touch of sweet, sun-ripened cherry on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An impressive, ripe wine, this is packed with baked apple and grapefruit flavors, with a taut, mineral texture. It needs at least a year to round out.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This elegant Barolo shows tight astringency and firm layers of red fruit, spice, crushed stone and tobacco. It needs a few more years to find harmony. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Inky and dark, this has modern touches of toasted oak and exotic spice. Those smoky aromas will decrease with time, giving prominence to the cherry and blackberry flavors already present.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged in large oak casks, this shows natural intensity and purity that is evident its quality of fruit and elegant nature. Aromas include ginger, forest berry, white truffle and cola. The tannins are fine and silky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the elegant and bright 2006 vintage, this shows aromas of spice, red fruit, leather, cola and cedar. The palate is attractive, showing tight, polished tannins and lively fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You can taste the sunshine embedded in this darkly concentrated Barolo. Ripe fruit aromas of blackberry and cherry liqueur open the bouquet and segue to notes of leather, spice and black licorice. The mouthfeel is plump, rich and well structured.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows tight lines and pretty aromas of wild cherry, spice, sweet fruit and blue flower. The palate delivers power and elegance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rarely bottled on its own, Pinot Meunier is better known as a blending component for Champagne. This bottling is like a Pinot Noir in its lightly silky texture and cherry, cola and vanilla flavors. It's very elegant, yet doesn't quite rise to the classic status of Pinot Noir.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Guidoalberto is the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cpocketbook-friendly\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d alternative from the same estate that makes Sassicaia. But for $60, you could ask for more. This is a chewy, succulent wine with good length on the close. The aromas are awkward in places with espresso, chocolate yogurt and a touch of cheese rind.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of espresso, black pepper, oak, chocolate and blackberry jam waft out of the glass. The dense, concentrated palate delivers brandied black cherry, licorice, raisin and coffee alongside firm, gripping tannins that leave the palate dry on the finish. Give the tannins another two or three years to unwind and then enjoy.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of raw red berry, chopped herb and a slight whiff of cellar floor. The tight palate offers raspberry, morello cherry, white pepper and licorice alongside austere but refined tannins. Give this a few more years to fully come together. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Slow to show its quality, with a little aeration this becomes a superripe wine, its wood element dominated by the intense tropical fruits. There is some balancing restraint in the citrus character, along with the acidity. Enjoy now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is not inclined to give much away at this early stage. The palate, however, freely gives wonderfully tart apple fruit that has a juicy ripeness and the tang of lemon. The palate is dry and streamlined, with a wonderfully racy focus of freshness and concentration. Yet this remains svelte and toned. It is the lemony tang that creates such a deliciously lip-smacking and refreshing finish. Lovely now but sure to develop. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From four vineyard sites across the appellation, this coastal wine shows an intriguing note of rose petal and turned earth before unleashing full-bodied waves of chewy, cool-climate tannin. Its rhubarb and red cherry fruit has a savory edge; acidity carries it long into the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A subtle hint of sandalwood and rose plays alongside the juicy pear of the palate. There is a rich floral creaminess on the palate that flashes a touch of vanilla and hints of Damask rose. A pleasantly bitter phenolic edge gives direction to the dynamic energy of fruit that trembles at the core of this wine. Hints of rose, lemon oil and peach linger long after the last sip. This is concentrated, off dry and energetic. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Way too oaky, with buttered toast, honey and caramel flavors dominating. The underlying wine, which is crisp in acidity and suggests limes, peaches and apricots, just isn't strong enough to handle all that oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a hard-edged wine, a typical trait of young Pommard. It has a firm, dry and tannic character, and the ripe, generous fruit sits underneath. Wait for at least five years for this wine to be ready.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full bodied and ripe, this Chardonnay is packed with yellow fruit and pear flavors, and it shows the steely, minerally character typical of Chablis. It has a youthful brightness on the finish, and it will fill out over the next few months.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tastes unusually lush and soft for a Napa Cab. While it's officially dry, sweet, caramelized oak and raspberry-jam flavors, along with a slick, glycerine mouthfeel, makes it as rich as a candy bar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A high-toned pitch of ripe pear and tart apple is like a clarion call. Residual sweetness on the palate mollifies that distinct, primal acidity, lending life to notes of dried peach and fresh apricot. Layers of flavor shimmer and shift, with apple notes that last and last.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Just next door to the Corton Grand Cru vines, this vineyard can produce wines of equal quality. This wine certainly has something of the richness and structure, giving it concentration and longevity. Ripe red fruits are cut by dark tannins and equal acidity, allowing the wine to mature slowly and well. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The grapes for this beautiful wine come from a sloping, high-elevation site, coaxed into expression by Winemaker Bob Cabral. Barrel-aged 10 months in French oak, 40% of it new, it opens with touches of butter and matchstick before blowing off the doors with butterscotch, baked lemon and balanced, oaky spice. Voluptuous on the palate, this is a stunner.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a vineyard that is wholly owned by Chanson. It is juicy, ripe while having a great, straight line of acidity. The red-berry fruits are still developing and coming through the firm, smoky dark tannins. The wine, with its spicy aftertaste, will be ready to drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This rich wine is dense with dark tannins and concentrated structure. The vineyard, with cool winds from the valley behind, gives wines that demand aging with their tannins and fragrant fruit. The aftertaste is full of promise. Drink after 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rich, smoky and structured wine. Black fruit and dark tannins form a dense texture with touches of licorice, spice and dark concentration. The acidity hints at the vintage giving a touch of freshness and lift. Drink this powerful wine from 2024\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A flagship of the Faiveley range, this is a structured wine with great acidity and beautiful perfumes. The wine is dense, already balanced with the red fruits shining through the tannins. It will develop slowly and will not be ready to drink before 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An earthy wine that offers complexity around a full-bodied juiciness of blackberry and bitter black tea, this is made in a big style and will appeal to fans of concentration and decisive use of oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A new offering made entirely from estate fruit, this is a selection of the best blocks and barrels of the vintage, with its core component being 90% Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. The remainder is Zinfandel. Together they provide black color and a whiff of bay leaf and peppercorn, around well-integrated layers of black cherry, vanilla and black tea.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A compelling wine. Made from this Bordeaux blending variety seldom seen bottled on its own, the grapes were grown in the Stagecoach Vineyard, high up on Atlas Peak, increasingly a source of some of Napa's greatest red wines. The style is thoroughly modern, with soft tannins and rich flavors of chocolate, black cherries, cassis and new oak, as well as a pleasing charred meatiness. Hard to tell where it's going, but delicious now. Decant for an hour or two before serving.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The intensity of this wine is extraordinary, with huge spice flavors and a richness that almost becomes sweetness. There is honey as well as ripe white fruits, the acidity just a glint in the aftertaste.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Clos Windsbuhl produces an opulently rich and sweet wine, gorgeously ripe and packed with tropical fruits. It is dense and powerfully concentrated, intense and very ageworthy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stefano Accordini's vineyard-designate Amarone opens with big oak and Spanish cedar tones that will undoubtedly come into focus with more aging time in the cellar. The wine shows excellent concentration and long flavors of spice, black fruit and tobacco. Pair it with sharp pecorino cheese.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb. It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This intense wine has great ripe fruit and sweetness to go with the pear and honey flavors. There is great acidity and beautiful fruit character in a gorgeous wine that still keeps its style and freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pure sweetness, the wine has a rich texture with just a hint of botrytis but plenty of opulent spice, very rounded and unctuous. It is just beginning to show maturity, but could easily age further, the sweetness so well integrated into the orange zest finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sartori hits a home run with this beautiful edition of Amarone Corte Br\\u00c3\\u00a0. The wine's deep layers reveal balsam aromas of cola and cedar, accented by spicy intensity and a long, smoky aftertaste. Dried fruit, chocolate and leather help build momentum on the finish. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet spent nearly two years in 100% new French oak. As a result, it's enormously oaky in youth. You can barely smell or taste anything beyond toothpicks. But the wine is still young and very tannic, and with a massive core of blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it's a ticking time bomb, just waiting to explode. Hold for at least six years and see what happens.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The brownish color indicates that it's fading, and the raisiny, stewed fruit on the nose confirms that initial indications are on target. In the mouth, it's soft, and the cherry fruit has a kirsch-like liqueur quality to it. Faded tannins and barely vital acids say it's going, going and soon to be gone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Paola Gloder's estate can do better than this, especially in a vintage like 1997. The wine is already showing signs of aging and it has a lightweight character. The fruit is pleasant enough, with soft tannins and ripeness, but it should be more exciting. Tasted twice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hailing from the winery's In the Rocks Vineyard, this wine opens with aromas of nori, black olive and blackberry that evolve into herb and plum. The dark fruit flavors are sweet and concentrated, lightly tacky in feel, backed by velvety-soft tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Joined by 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this stellar wine from an almost 50-50 Napa-Sonoma divide delivers big flavor and tannin and yet exudes vibrant juicy plum and blueberry, keeping it grounded and alive. Silky through and through, it's complex in dark chocolate and a touch of dried herbs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gentle giant of a wine, subtle and sublime in earthy rose petals, allspice and black tea that maintain a spiky, lively acidity throughout. Blueberry and black cherry compete for attention, balancing the grapes' more savory intentions, before a smoothly intense finish rides things out.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cupano is an organic farm in Montalcino with consistent delivery of quality red wines. This less formal Rosso di Montalcino offers ripe cherry and blackberry notes followed by aromas of wet earth, leather and fresh tobacco. Pair it with Irish lamb stew.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, rich, showy Chardonnay. Barrel fermented and aged in 80% new French oak, it shows buttered toast and charry vanilla bean aromas and flavors. The fruit below is good, if a little heavy and ripe, suggesting apricots and pears. Best now in its youth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light and tonic with raw notes of cherry and forest fruit, this is a bright, easy-drinking Rosso di Montalcino. Pair it with lamb, rosemary and roasted potatoes. The wine's natural acidity and tannins can stand up to the consistency of those dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 80% new oak on this wine really sticks out, giving toasty, caramelized and vanilla bean notes. That makes the underlying cherry, blackberry and raspberry fruit, which is superripe, taste jammy, almost sweet. The result is a little in your face, but it's quite a rich wine that might develop some bottle nuance over the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Easily recognizable thanks to its elaborate bottle encrusted with Swarovski crystals, Diadema is a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah. It shows dense black cherry, black currant and underbrush along with oak, coffee and vanilla. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's shy on freshness but the fruit is appealing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This creamy sparkler has a floral fragrance of white flower and pear. The palate delivers tropical fruit, citrus, bitter almond and sage notes. This is a classic ap\\u00c3\\u00a9ritif and perfect for making toasts.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crisp with brisk acidity, yet bright with citrus and yellow fruit, this wine shows structure as well as warmth. It's a textured wine that can age over the medium term. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of barrique-aged Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon has a fragrance of oak and bell pepper. The palate shows red currant, cherry, oak, coffee and chocolate notes. Although it has generous fruit, it lacks complexity and is shy on freshness and vitality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Amarone shows overripe black fruit, oak and raisin aromas. The palate offers extracted plum and black cherry flavors layered with chocolate, vanilla, oak and black pepper notes. It's closes on a note of bitter almond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Doesn't say so on the label, but this is largely Syrah, with 8% Grenache. It's a well-structured, balanced wine whose high alcohol wears itself well around the blackberries and currants. But it does lack the concentration and drama of previous bottlings, evidence of the difficult 2011 vintage. Ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Paulliac-style blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot presents bright red fruit on the nose alongside black licorice and traditional cigar box scents. The flavors are dominated by red cherries with a touch of anise, sprig of thyme and pleasingly brisk finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a rich, caramel-teased nose, this is a full-bodied and voluptuous Chardonnay that evolves in the glass to display much greater sophistication and concentration. It finishes light and lemony, rounded out by juicy stone fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tastes as ripe, bright and spicy as it smells, with intense, pure flavors of raspberry, strawberry and cherry essence dusted with crushed white pepper, cinnamon and vanilla. Drink this light-bodied, savory young Pinot now and over the next year or two.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and sweet in black cherry jam, cassis, chocolate, anise and cedar flavors that are delicious, but heavy, trading elegance and finesse in favor of opulent power. It's the poster child for Napa Cabernet made in the modern cult style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The tannins on this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend are strong. They numb the mouth, but not so much that you can't enjoy the ripe black currant, cassis and smoky oak flavors. With its inherent balance, the wine should have no trouble aging, so give it eight years in the cellar.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Everything about this Cab is out-sized. The color is black, the black currant and cassis flavors are mind-blowingly huge, the oak presence is strong, the tannins are thick, and the finish is long and spicy. It's nowhere near ready to drink. Give it at least eight more years to let the parts find each other and integrate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend has high ambitions, to judge by the richness. It is absolutely massive in blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and caramelized oak. It's far too strong to enjoy now, lacking any sense of proportion, but it does seem like a good cellar candidate. Give it until 2017 and see if it begins to calm down.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hard as nails in tannins, with mouth-numbing astringency. But the powerful fruit explodes right through, offering an array of blackberry jam, dark chocolate, raisin and anise flavors. Try cellaring it until at least 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich, full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Malbec, this offers sizable tannins that wrap themselves around dark, brooding fruit and smoky oak. Blackberry and plum intertwine around luxurious chocolate and tobacco, complementing one another on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of perfumed berry, rose petal, scorched earth and spice lead the nose. On the palate, bracing tannins and bright acidity support crunchy strawberry, black cherry, clove and licorice. This is still all wound up and needs time to open. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the winery's last takes on this vineyard, as they move their focus to Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. The nose is blackberry liqueur lifted with chopped black sage, fennel stalk and tobacco leaf. Flavors run from dark red fruit to black spices to tartness on the finish, like a balsamic reduction sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry, raspberry and asphalt aromas are staunch and gritty. A tight, firm, structured palate is balanced from front to back, while dark berry flavors are woody, dry, toasty and spicy. The big, solid, oaky finish is right on the money. Best from 2016 through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is earthy, heavyset and reflective of a hot vintage. On the palate, this is ripe and chewy, with almost syrupy weight. Showing notes of robust dark chocolate, with a mix of oak, fruit and tobacco flavors, this inaugural wine from Benjamin de Rothschild and Vega Sicilia is ripe and broad, but also full of complexities. Drink through 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Wild berry, exotic spice, crushed violet and a whiff of Mediterranean herb aromas lead the way. The polished, austere palate offers up dried black cherry, leather, anise and white pepper framed in assertive tannins. Give this a few more years to soften then enjoy. Drink from 2019 through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas of menthol, mature plum, cassis and a hint of cedar on this structured blend of 85% Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. On the ripe, round palate, licorice and graphite accent the core of dried black cherry. Fine-grained tannins provide polished support. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of graphite, underbrush, toasted oak and dark berry lead the nose. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry, anise, grilled sage and espresso alongside bracing, grippy tannins.

A good food wine, with enough acidity to stay refreshing, this is a fine, fairly larger-production white built to impress.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Waxy cherry and pomegranate invite the senses before a taste of dried cranberry wafts in, layering itself on top of velvety, silky tannins. Juicy and well-composed, it hails from an appellation not known for the variety. In the hands of this producer, also a fine craftsman of Cabernet, this wine simply sings.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lively and approachable with vinous tones of cherry, raspberry and cola, Col di Lamo delivers a bright, food-friendly Brunello. There's also a very attractive touch of chopped mint or eucalyptus on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Donatella Cinelli Colombini regularly brings us very soft, rich and velvety expressions of Brunello. This vintage, however, is more austere, reserved and seems to need more time to open and breathe in the glass. As it does, it reveals layers of cherry, almond paste, smoke, vanilla and powdered chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is exuberantly rich and sweet in ripe blackberry, black cherry and chocolate fruit. Smoky oak plays a crucial role, in both flavors and texture. It's a very pretty, polished wine, elegant and balanced and ready to drink now. Production was a hefty 11,000 cases.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Riserva Chianti Classico opens with earthy, gritty aromas of forest floor, wild mushroom and deep, dark berry fruit. It shows a layered, sophisticated side of Sangiovese with lingering spice and cola on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: . There's a compact, traditional characteristic here that gives this wine smooth, sophisticated appeal. Aromas include white cherry, dried raspberry, tar, licorice and root beer. Twenty percent Malvasia Nera is added to the blend.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an amazingly rich Cabernet, packed with classic Napa blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors. It's opulent even by California standards, and is a little sweet. With firm, pronounced tannins, it's gritty in texture. Defines Napa ripeness, but at this point it's rude and jammy. Give it a good six years. Could be one for the long haul.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a Merlot and Cabernet Franc blend from Calistoga. The wine is made in the Coup de Foudre style, which is soft, sensual and immediately attractive. Shows blueberry, black cherry and dark chocolate flavors, with a deft touch of oak, but also notable tannins. Seems too soft to age, so drink over the next four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Carignano (85%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, Barrua is the so-called Sassicaia of Sardinia. (In fact, it represents a partnership between the island's most prestigious co-op, Cantina di Santadi and the makers of Tuscany's Sassicaia.) This beautiful vintage shows wild sage, black currant and loads of soft spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A big, modern-style contender with burly berry, lemon, coconut, dill and blackberry on the bouquet. Lush and cushioned in the mouth, with meaty, dark flavors of roasted blackberry, espresso and fudge. Chewy and dense on the finale, but not overly hard or tannic. Drink now through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of delicious, complex blackberry, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis, mineral and cedar flavors in this dry, tannic wine. One quibble is the acidity, which is overly sharp and feels odd, given how ripe the wine is.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is full of fruit and weighty tannins. Coming from one of the finest vineyards in Burgundy, it is going to have great power and an opulent nature. This wine also has elegance, its black fruits controlled and with a mineral edge. That doesn't take away the power, it enhances the stylishness of this grand wine. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Initially, this is a richly ripe wine with tropical fruit flavors. It also has an immense sense of structure that supports the fruit impressively. It's dense, concentrated, exuding power and solidity, while always keeping a sense of elegance. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is powerful and rich, allowing just a note of freshness to creep into the firm structure. Dark tannins, black fruits and smoky wood flavors combine harmoniously, lending a sense of great power and long-term aging potential. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This could be the best Astrales to date. Alluring scents of plum, blueberry and spice are backed by balsam dust and briary pipe-tobacco aromas. Deep and tannic on the palate, then packed with mocha, chocolate, toasted marshmallow, cassis and cherry cough drop flavors, this is fixed and firm now, with a staunch, intense, nervy finish. Drink from 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Candied cherry, cola, brown sugar and toasty oak flavors give this Pinot an immediate deliciousness. Savory acidity and fine tannins add to the sense of balanced importance. While it isn't an ager, it is a dramatic Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry aromas are touched up by graphite, char and herbal accents. This feels wide, with wall-to-wall tannins and extracted flavors of loam and earthy plum and blackberry. A lead-pencil note is reprised on the finish, which is tannic in feel and loaded with herbal black-fruit character.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: New leather, pressed blue flower, wild berry and a whiff of game are some of the aromas you'll find in this taut, structured red. The palate offers mature black cherry, licorice and vanilla flavors, while assertive, close-grained tannins give the finish grip. Give this time to let those tannins mellow. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truffle, new leather, coconut and spiced plum aromas come together in the glass. The taut, full-bodied palate delivers mature black cherry, licorice, coffee and ground pepper set against a backdrop of fine-grained tannins that give it a firm texture. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright red-skinned berry, new leather, herb and dark spice aromas waft out of the glass. It's medium-bodied on the palate, with star anise and tobacco notes adding depth to the fresh cherry core. Taut, refined tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a touch overripe and plummy, akin to a puree on the nose. Smoky oak lurks behind the fruit, along with a taste of almond and tea. In the end, the wine ends robustly and full-figured, with plenty of power and concentration to the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a simple, slightly sweet wine. It tastes like a pineapple, lime and vanilla pastry melted down into wine, with alcohol giving heat, and acidity to make it crisp.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Campo dei Gigli is a blockbuster wine with dark concentration, enormous richness and intense aromas of blackberry, BBQ sauce, sweet cherry and mesquite smoke. The wine tastes round and supple and offers a long, smooth finish. Drink after 2015. Amazing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Unless you knew that this was Dominus and had tasted older vintages, you might not be impressed. In its youth the wine is tannic and dry and linear. However, it is Dominus and it does need cellaring. Right now it shows blackberry, black currant, cedar and baker's chocolate flavors. Will slowly open and reach maturity after 2011, and could easily develop for far longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With more than a decade of careful aging under its belt, Vigneti di Osan Amarone offers sweet cherry flavors, dark concentration and bright aromas of vanilla and spice. The wine still makes a big impact in the mouth and is a delightful surprise overall.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the most familiar of the Meursault Premier Crus, this wine is crisp and mineral in character. It has tight acidity with apple and green-plum fruit that is laced by a light amount of wood aging. The wine is still young and will be better from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This two-acre premier cru situated north of Beaune city gives smooth and rich wines. This bottling shows the acidity of the vintage while also having a full, round character, ripe with strawberries and crisp with acidity. The wine needs more time, so drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The first Merlot offering from this producer, this is 100% varietal and totally full-throttle in its fleshy components of vanilla and chocolate, seasoned in cinnamon. Fresh and somewhat floral, it's bright despite its size and lively on the palate. The wine is made in tiny amounts.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The enthusiastic use of wood for this wine gives a dark, spicy character that masks any fruit. Less new wood would have helped highlight the natural fruitiness of the wine. Leave it until 2020 and the fruit may fill out. Winemaker Stephan Carrier returned from Napa to take over winemaking after Irish businessman Lochlann Quinn bought the property in 2001.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While showing too much wood at the moment, this wine has potential. The red berries and black currants promise a fruity future with good tannins in support. Give the wine a few years and drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: After the promise of the wine at its initial barrel tasting, this bottled wine is less exciting. Berry fruits are muted by the extracted tannins. It's likely the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A gentle but flashy reserve-style Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich in blackberry jam, currants and anise, with touches of smoky oak. The acid-tannin structure gives it the refinement of an upscale Napa Cab.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Creamy and fresh, this opens with aromas of pressed yellow flowers, dried orchard fruit, toast and pastry. The foaming palate doles out ripe apple, butterscotch, pastry cream and toasted walnut alongside a soft mousse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of wild rose, baked apple and bread crust lead the nose on this deeply hued ros\\u00c3\\u00a9. The vibrant palate offers raspberry, raw strawberry and an intense note of orange peel alongside zesty acidity and a persistent perlage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 50% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Malbec, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc shows cocoa dust, leather, beef jerky, dried blueberries and boysenberries on the nose. The palate is dense with tarry fruit notes, offering dark elderberries and smoked beef flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An elegant Rioja made in a more traditional style. The nose is a little baked and raisiny, with additional aromas of caramel and leather. The palate is where this wine shines: the feel is elegant and smooth, while the cherry and raspberry flavors are subtle and a little bit tangy. Mature and sexy stuff; more classic than modern, but not 100% old-school.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This very dry wine is dominated by its hard tannins, and comes across as a bit rigid and austere, especially by California standards. Yet it's very finely structured, with a keen edge of black pepper to the currant and blackberry flavors buried way beneath. Give it through 2009, but if you must drink now, decant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Questionable value at $70, but this is very good and rather unique white Rioja. Remelluri uses a multitude of common and unheard-of grapes, and they hit it with a lot of oak. Still, amid the oily richness there's balance, acidity and excellent layering of grass, spice, apple, banana and lemon flavors. Big at 14.5%, but it will go really well with baked fish or lobster.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with Malvasia grapes from the beautiful and rustic island of Salina (off the northern coast of Sicily), Capofaro's luscious dessert wine is richly redolent of honey, dried banana, apricot and dried flowers. This is a gorgeous wine with syrupy but smooth density and tangy candied fruit flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vibrant and full of good cheer, this ruby-colored Recioto boasts cherry, red apple, Turkish spice, leather and dark chocolate. In fact, it would make a perfect companion to chocolate-based dishes. The mouthfeel is chewy and rich with lively cherry intensity and silky tannins. It is worth pointing out, however, that I tasted three corked bottles before finding a good one.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With sharp acidity, a hot mouthfeel and rich flavors of cassis liqueur and chocolate-covered raisins, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend tastes more like Port than a dry table wine. Lots of new French oak does not restore balance. Drink up.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: If you're looking for classic Napa Cabernet, this utterly delicious bottling is right there. Blended with some Petit Verdot and Merlot, it's a selection of the winery's extensive acreage across the Stags Leap, Rutherford, Carneros and Oakville appellations, showcasing the synergy of blending. The wine is dry, full-bodied, firm in tannins and extraordinarily lush, with blackberry, black currant, chocolate, plum, toasty oak and spice flavors. It's so good now thay you can drink it, but it holds the inherent balance to age for up to 15 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this structured wine opens with fruit and spice aromas of blackberry, raspberry, white pepper and clove alongside hints of leather and tar. The juicy palate delivers a core of vibrant black cherry accented with white pepper and cinnamon-spice. Bracing but refined tannins carry through to the long finish. Give this time to fully develop complexity. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the most dramatic Chardonnays of the vintage, which was a difficult one owing to the coldest summer in many years. Somehow, Hartford Court's viticulturalists pulled it off. There's no trace of the greenness or unripeness that mark some other '11 Chards. Instead, you'll find waves of awesomely ripe apricots, tangerines and pears, enriched with smoky oak and brightened with brisk acidity. Terrific now and over the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's an outstanding Chianti Classico made from 80% Sangiovese, 10% Pugnitello and 10% Colorino that opens with earthy aromas of underbrush, leather, violet, dark spices and red berries. The structured palate delivers rich black cherry, black pepper, clove and balsamic herbs alongside bracing yet refined tannins. It still shows some youthful aggression, so give it time to soften and develop complexity. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Silex is a flint and sand soil that suits Sauvignon Blanc well. This wine, with tight, nervy texture and crisp lemon character, is still fresh, full of primary citrus and gooseberry flavors. It needs until 2015 to fully integrate and show rich concentration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This was the final vintage Patrick Campbell fully presided over before selling the winery. It's a dense and compact wine, showing mountain tannins framing black currant, cassis, mineral, violet and new oak flavors. Despite the opulence, the finish is dry. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine needs time in the cellar. Try it after 2018, and it should be rolling along in the mid-2020s.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: California Malbec by itself tends to be straightforward, which might be why the winemaker blended this one with a bit of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The result is excellent, one of the best Malbecs in California, with rich blackberry, currant and cedar flavors. The strong tannins suggest it should pair well with beef.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of cherry marinated in spirits, coffee and a balsamic note that carry over to the tightly wound palate along with licorice and sage. Bracing tannins give it an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is still rather closed, but eventually reveals aromas suggesting red berry, clove and a balsamic note that carry over to the bracing palate along with raspberry extract. It's tightly tannic, with an Amaretto-like finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plump and inviting black cherry fruit melds with char, soy and purple flower aromas on the nose of this atypical blend of 38% Syrah, 31% Cabernet Franc and 31% Merlot. The wine is cohesive on the palate, with persistent tannins and smoke, coffee, red fruit and dried herb flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, baking spice and leather aromas meld together along with a whiff of aromatic herb. The already accessible palate offers dried cherry, tobacco, smoke and a salty note of cured meat framed in seasoned tannins. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This robust concentrated red is made from an unusual field blend of Sereksiya Charni and Saperavi, two grape varieties more known in Eastern Europe than the United States. It's lush in black-cherry flavor, accented with chocolate, black pepper, vanilla and spice, but also densely tannic and searing in acidity. While unwieldy in its youth, it's a wine that consistently shows excellence with maturity. Hold till 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With 3% Syrah, this wine has a leathery, gamy character to it, the grapes grown at high elevation. Blueberry and blackberry notes provide a robust backdrop of fruitiness, as chewy, smoky tannins support concentrated black cherry flavor on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: French oak, coconut, underbrush and a balsamic aroma follow through to the full-bodied palate along with licorice, espresso, dried cherry and raw cranberry. Raspy tannins provide the assertive frame work and clench the finish. Give the tannins a few years to relax then drink to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Oaky and superconcentrated, with shoe polish and other dark aromas forming a cap on the bouquet. Airing reveals a rugged, fully oaked and tannic wine, with baked berry, baking spice, raisin, syrup and chocolate flavors all wrapped up in a chewy, chunky frame. Sweet, rich and saturated stuff. Drink now or hold through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec from both the Sonoma Valley and Alexander Valley appellations, that works in its big, broad and tannic approach to ripeness and bold flavor. Plum, cranberry and currant provide fruit as black olive plays on the back of the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and sensual in the mouth, this offers rich, complex layers of cherries, red plums, mocha and cedar. So gentle and luscious, you can drink it now, despite the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one tight young Pinot Noir. You take the first sip, and the acidity hits you, then the tannins, and finally the fruit, which is ripe and vast in raspberries and strawberries. Oak adds smoky caramel to this parfait. Give it until 2018 or 2019, when it should hit its peak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine remains astringent in tannins, with a lockded-down mouthfeel that's hard to get past. But it's very rich in blackberry and cherry fruit. Is it worth aging? It's hard to tell if 10 years will be of benefit, but the tannins seem likely to outlast the fruit. Drink up over the next 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe raspberry fruit with a vanilla overlay also shows a rich, herbal character, touches of spice and bright final acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This simple wine is thick with fruit-forward dark cherry and currant elements that find companionship in coffee, graphite and dried herb accents.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This aromatic Priorat is 72% Carignan and the rest Garnacha. Aromas of floral bath soap, cinnamon and cedar accent plum and berry scents. In the mouth, this is built like a tank. Spicy chocolaty black-plum and cassis flavors finish chewy and thick, with notes of mint and licorice. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a finely perfumed wine. It has a strong sense of structure with its tight tannins. It also has lively crisp red fruits that give both acidity and richness to a wine that will develop well. Drink from 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Chopped mint, new leather, forest floor and spiced plum aromas take shape in the glass. The ripe, juicy palate doles out fleshy black cherry, raspberry jam, clove and licorice notes, supported by big, rounded tannins. It's already accessible and seriously delicious. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heady aromas of cola, blackberry and licorice set up a youthful choppy palate with hard tannins and a sense of skins. Blackberry, licorice and charred toasty oak flavors finish dry, spicy and with a strong note of dark chocolate. Drink through 2028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A lovely wine, soft and supple, with a superb tannin structure framing the most interesting and delicious flavors. Blackberries, blueberries, red and black currants, anise and cedar notes all come together in balanced harmony, leading to a long, dry finish. Not an ager, but an elegant Napa Valley wine to drink now and over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll want to give this vigorous young Cab time in the cellar to come around. It's tannic and closed now, and the blackberry and cherry fruit has a primary fruit jamminess that wants to develop some bottle-aged characteristics. Give it until 2017 to begin to come around.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black olive stars in this supple, soft and supremely varietal wine, wrapped in strong, chalky tannin. Full bodied and completely generous in ripe fruit, it shows complexity and lengthiness on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The second vintage by this producer from this highly regarded vineyard, this wine shows how racy the site can be, cooled from Petaluma Gap winds and fog and yet also robustly capable of ripe, rich red fruit. Measured acidity buoys a densely concentrated wine chewy and bright in pine, dark cherry, cranberry, strawberry and earth. The finish is lean and citrusy. Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of scorched earth, truffle, woodland berry, sage and a whiff of cured meat unfold on this firm red while ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, grilled herb and clove wrap around the palate. Tightly wound tannins support the savory flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark fruit shows on the palate in this exotically spiced and floral blend from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road. Soft and medium in weight, it has high-toned acidity underneath the brooding spice and forest floor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe black-skinned fruit, underbrush, leather, sunbaked earth and a whiff of crushed herb come together on this solid red. The round palate doles out juicy wild cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon, a hint of vanilla and anise alongside robust, velvety tannins that impart muscle and polish. A note of grilled sage closes the finish. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the top vineyard areas in Pouilly Fum\\u00c3\\u00a9, this wine is rich, concentrated and with a great aging potential. Structured and with yellow fruits superimposed over the crisper, citrus flavors, it's still young and tight. Give this impressive wine until 2019 before drinking.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a satisfying, small-production wine from four rows of the family's Kairos Vineyard, a study in sanguine intensity. Currant, cassis and tar integrate with the body of subtle oak and tannin, finishing in a sprinkling of dried herb and graphite.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pressed iris, violet, dark-skinned berry, tobacco and a whiff of game emerge on this robust red. The ripe, full-bodied palate delivers juicy Morello cherry, raspberry, crushed aromatic herbs and licorice alongside tightly packed, velvety tannins. The fruit richness deftly supports the hefty 15% declared on the label.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the producer best known for its own Anderson Valley estate wines, this Pinot is varietally rustic in pine needle, dark, baked plum and smoky oak, the oak stylistically reminiscent of many of its other wines. Mellowed acidity complements the burliness and ripeness of the fruit before a lengthy, Asian-spiced finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and ripe, this has concentration both from the apple, pear and apricot fruits and also from its steely, mineral texture. It's deliciously full in the mouth. Drink from late 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of grilled herb, dark spice and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose. The ripe, generous palate doles out succulent black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and nutmeg alongside round, velvety tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This richly concentrated wine surprises in its uplifting acidity on the back of the palate. Light, bright and full of Gravenstein apple goodness, it is well structured and refreshingly unfussy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Chopped herb, fragrant purple flower, dark spice and balsamic aromas come together on this. The concentrated, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, dried plum, nutmeg, anise and mineral while firm velvety tannins provide support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Savory black-olive aromas lend some funk to the nose of this tight pointy massively tannic Tempranillo. Flavors of olive, black fruits and chocolate finish with hard drying tannins and flavors of black coffee, additional chocolate and peppery spice. Drink from 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This very rich, unctuous Syrah is immature and not especially subtle at this time. It's acidic and gooey in jammy blackberries and cherries and milk chocolate, with obvious oak influences. The idea seems to be ageworthiness, but that's a gamble. Could surprise.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In this vintage, Monsanto's flagship wine, made from 90% Sangiovese Grosso, is a prime example of traditional Chianti. It features racy, dry cherry fruit, hard edges and structure galore. Whether it will evolve into a more open and friendly wine remains to be seen; normally Il Poggio ages well and improves in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This elegant Brunello shows loads of Montalcino typicity thanks to its aromas of cherry, forest floor, moist earth, dried violets and white almond. It delivers a tight, streamlined feel that is driven forward by the wine's polished tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full-bodied and firmly structured, this offers aromas of dark cherry, mocha, blue flower and a whiff of exotic spice. The concentrated palate doles out black cherry, raspberry jam, raisin, chocolate and baking spice alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle notes of orange meet freshly-cut pear flavors, amplified by some residual sugar. The richness of the palate is cut beautifully by a fresh and pure, citric acidity and a wrought phenolic structure which lends pleasant notes of subtle, enticing bitterness. There is something bittersweet about this that is touching and alluring.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Honeyed notes of pear promise oriental richness. The palate cuts this opulence, edged with Seville orange spice and a streak of zesty lime. This interplay between baroque and discipline continues, creating a scintillating experience. Enjoy the ride and marvel at all the spicy overtones.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Orange peel perfumes the rich pear notes and imbues them with the aromatic spice of citrus foliage and zest. The palate is full of friendly citrus and pear. Despite its texture and rich flavor, it's beautifully slender and light-footed, with an inherent, zesty brightness that makes this wine shine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The restrained and floral opening of jasmine and mandarin peel leads to a palate that holds just a touch of residual sugar, filling this gorgeously balanced Gewurztraminer to the brim with sweet citrus swirls of tangerine, satsuma and mandarin. Notes of orange blossom hover and are pulled into focus by the textured mouthfeel of this immensely elegant wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very ripe, red-cheeked Mirabelles and orange peel represent the aromatic top notes. With more air, mandarin juice becomes apparent, and the palate is wonderfully taut and concentrated. There is a haunting purity and a strong undertow of earth and stone that soars on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pungent earth opens this wine, the small-production label of Napa Valley geologist and worldwide soils expert Dr. Paul Skinner, who has named it appropriately to mark its literal roots. A strip of red berry and vanilla highlight the palate of this overall bright and balanced wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big, firm and dense, this is a powerful wine, with dark tannins that give a dry, concentrated character. The juicy plum and damson fruit flavors, along with the fresh aftertaste, will be a delicious balance as the wine develops. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stemmy earth and dark, savory pine give in to saut\\u00c3\\u00a9ed mushroom and cinnamon in this lean, soft and delicious estate-grown wine. A tension of acidity buoys a backdrop of wild strawberry and cranberry on the palate, ending with just the right amount of weight and length, succulent to the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leafy underbrush, new leather, dark berry and chopped herb aromas waft out of the glass. The fresh, chewy palate doles out succulent wild cherry, ripe raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon notes, blanketed in smooth, round tannins. A licorice note caps off the finish. It's already delicious but will also offer fine drinking over the next several years. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dried herb, dust and compost provide a dark underbelly in this vineyard-designated varietal wine. It's layered with caramel and toffee notes that are complemented by bright acidity and further freshened by sparks of pomegranate and cassis.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of equal parts of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, this opens with mature blackberry, cedar and underbrush aromas. The juicy, creamy palate delivers black cherry, black currant, mint and tobacco flavors, with velvety tannins and a long finish. Enjoy through 2028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Jack Hill is a steep, cold site near Occidental, made hearty by the winds of the Pacific Ocean. The grapes in this bottling take on a caramelized, grenadine/kirsch-like richness. Tangy cranberry and citrus, layered atop a light, bright body, are girded by an underlying juiciness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Savory smoked-pork notes meet with blueberry soda, teriyaki and white pepper on the nose of this blend of 49% Syrah, 24% Petite Sirah, 15% Grenache and 12% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre. Soy, teriyaki, crushed peppercorns and blackberry jam show on the palate, which is more restrained than exuberant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blends 75% Cabernet Sauvignon with 25% Petite Verdot, the Cabernet hailing from vineyards such as To Kalon and Dr. Crane. This wine is defined by its ripeness, a high-octane expression of coconut and soy with a syrupy concentration of blackberry and cherry that explodes with richness on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tightly woven and deeply concentrated, this brawny, full-bodied wine from the mighty mountain site boasts expansive tannins. Firm acidity invigorates its spectrum of flavors that range from cherry, marshmallow and clove to forest and tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in the Pride style, this is a big, powerful wine that should age well. It's enormously ripe, with flamboyant cassis, cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, licorice and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into thoroughly modern, softly refined tannins. Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the few Cab Francs in California that works on its own. It's really a gorgeous wine, showing the full-bodied firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon, but without the tannic weight and density. The flavors veer toward scrumptious red cherries, red currants, milk chocolate and anise, with a dry, complex finish. Lovely with a fine grilled steak and rosemary new potatoes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the winery's Annapolis Vineyard, at the cool, northern tip of the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ctrue\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Sonoma Coast, comes this chunky young Pinot Noir. Although the grapes were destemmed before fermentation, the tannins are significant, a reflection of the low yields and tough skins the berries develop. In fact, the wine is almost Zinny in its full body and spicy, briary fruit. It clearly needs time. Best after 2011.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a lovely and impressive sparkler with luminous intensity and more than a decade of careful aging. Aromas recall cedar wood, pineapple, apricot and hazelnut. It's an evolved and opulent wine with loads of personality and density.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Always pretty, always polished, St. Jean's '05 Cinq Cepages is a solid red wine that drinks well now and should develop with a few years in the cellar. It's dry and firm in tannins, with flavors of blackberries, cassis and new smoky oak, marked by a soft texture of finely ground tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a tropical element to this Cab, which otherwise traffics in bright red cassis and cranberry. The tannins are still resolving but tend to the softer side, woven tightly through to the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas espresso, toasted oak and a whiff of exotic spice lead the nose while the evolved palate shows mocha, oak and a note of dried black cherry before a rather abrupt finish. It's shy on freshness and lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the dominant wood sensations.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This soft, sweet, oaky Cabernet will appeal to those who like the New World style. It's as puffy as a dessert concoction, with cherry, chocolate, nougat and cinnamon spice flavors, and is ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh and juicy, this is a soft and rounded wine. It has gentle tannins, along with stylish acidity and red fruit flavors. Already, it is becoming drinkable, so don't expect the wine to age over the long term. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A 50-50 sparking blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes given more time in bottle, the DVX is light golden in color. Yeasty on the nose and dry on the palate, it offers a flurry of rich, full-bodied apple and wild berry layered atop a thick layer of minerality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Balsam notes of cola, deep spice, forest floor, sage and eucalyptus are long and ethereal. This is polished and bright with fine, firm tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A ripe sweet style, with blackberry and cherry liqueur, leather, tobacoo, rum cake and graham cracker. This wine's polished, distinctive finish features a rich, velvety feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello shows a feminine and bright personality, with aromas of leather, small berry fruit, cassis and licorice. It's structured and crisp, with good freshness and a silky mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Always a knockout Brunello, Uccelliera's 2006 Riserva seems on the ripe side, with jammy fruit aromas and savory beef jerky notes at the back. The firmness and natural acidity associated with Sangiovese is present, but the aromas show hints of candied fruit and spicy plum cake.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's an exotic, spicy element here that gives this riserva a unique and compelling quality. Coffee, espresso and bitter chocolate also identify it. The mouthfeel is dry and tight, suggesting long aging potential. More than fruit, this wine shows tertiary aromas and crushed mineral in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a broad, masculine Brunello with layers of spice, leather, Spanish cedar, cola and cured meat. The mouthfeel is streamlined and elegant, with crisp acidity and a solidly tannic base.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Serious wine for serious Ribera lovers, even if it's from a generally weak vintage. Smells of bacon grease, graphite and dark berry fruits. Feels tight and youthfully tannic, with hickory, smoked meat, clove, toast and blackberry flavors. Clove and spice rest heavily on the woody finish; needs time to evolve and absorb its oak treatment. Best from 2013\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Darkly concentrated, boldly aromatic and intense, this pretty Brunello delivers modern aromas of chocolate, espresso bean, ripe fruit, blackberry and rum cake. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, and the wine maintains its momentum thanks to the softness of its texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Notes of root beer, dried sage, wild berry and bramble with menthol overtones define this wine. There are subtle wood tones of spice, clove and black pepper, and the finish is crisp and streamlined with a touch of cherry sweetness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A new wine from Poggio Antico, Lemartine is a hearty blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot that offers intense and pristine aromas of black fruit, spice, rum cake, pepper and black pipe tobacco. It shows both substance and freshness on the long finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This elegant Brunello opens to a lean, streamlined style. The garnet color is true to the Sangiovese variety and so are the wine's aromas of forest berry, earth and pressed flower. You'll like the bright, soft close, with its tiny touch of fruity sweetness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Not an obvious wine by any stretch, this riserva opens slowly and bashfully to deliver small pulses of cherry, chocolate and smoked bacon that build in intensity and power as the wine gains momentum in the glass. The tannins are present but are soft and firm without any bitter astringency. Age 10 years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This attractive Brunello presents a wild, brambly side, with aromas of wild mushroom, forest floor, small berry and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis. It boasts a beautiful, deep color and plenty of concentration, with endnotes of spice, leather and dried tobacco leaf. The mouthfeel is solid, well defined and superbly structured.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A pretty and lusciously layered Brunello with dark fruit, spice, leather, tobacco and rum cake aromas. The wine is dense and chewy, with a tight, velvety feel. Dark fruit and spice push the wine across the palate, and both the acidity and tannins are softer than in other 2006 riservas.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 2007 Brunello is a big, opulent pleasure bomb with lavish layers, loaded thickly on top of each other: Chocolate fudge, dark cherry, blackberry preserves, rum cake, prune, exotic spice, pipe tobacco, cola, humus and leather. It shows huge personality, intensity and staying power, too. All that density is backed by solid tannins and a steady firmness. Hold 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Tuscany's celebrated Frescobaldi wine family, Brunello Castelgiocondo opens with dark, inky concentration and bold aromas of pressed rose, black cherry, exotic spice, leather and unsweetened chocolate. It is beautifully put together, with ample intensity, balance, complexity and silkiness on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Poggio all'Oro (a wine only produced in the best vintages) is a sophisticated and austere Brunello with just a tiny dab of sweet spice and red rose aromas on the bouquet. Beyond those are steady, savory pulses of tobacco, leather and dark cedar. The wine is plush, textured and rich, with a polished firmness that keeps it grounded on the palate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sweet oak tones of cinnamon, ripe cherry and raspberry are delivered via a beautifully intense bouquet. This is a Brunello with tight tannins, fresh acidity and solid structure.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rich and rounded, packed with yellow fruits and pineapple flavors, this is a warm, opulent wine, combining toast and fruit. True, there is some minerality, but this Meursault revels in its ripe fruit and generosity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello opens with an intense, dark garnet color and shows lush softness and ripe blackberry fruit with perfumed notes of blue flower, plum cake and sweet spice. The mouthfeel is characterized by firm structure and yielding tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Vintner Elisabetta Geppetti's Saffredi is part cult wine and part mainstream blockbuster in that the wine enjoys worldwide fame, but few know it well. This vintage is soft and luscious, with loads of dark chocolate, cherry, blackberry, tobacco and spice. It's gorgeous down to the last delicious drop.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This interpretation of Sangiovese Grosso is clean, polished, ripe and elegant. It opens with dark concentration and berry notes of cassis and candied cherry, and then rum cake, leather and tobacco show up on the finish, backed by firm tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This riserva is silky, firm and polished, with bright fruit nuances of wild berry, almond skin, cola and lingering menthol overtones. The mouthfeel is bright and crisp, with a very fine, smooth texture. Dusty mineral notes appear on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: La Magia Brunello is a brooding, masculine wine filled with tobacco smoke and cigar box. At the back are tones of dried fruit, blackberry preserves, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis and prune. It shows wonderful intensity and elegance with loads of personality. Spice, black pepper and bitter chocolate also appear on the long, silky finish. It promises to age well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This landmark Italian wine continues to show the best of Tuscany, as it faithfully does year after year. The quality is obvious, thanks to rich notes of chocolate, black cherry and spice that are wrapped tight within a lush, soft and texture. The close is velvety and very long.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gorgeous, beautiful Brunello. Dark concentration and excellent intensity. Loads of complexity that peels back slowly layer after layer as the wine evolves. Rock-solid structure and freshness that point to a happy cellar evolution. Aromas of dark fruit, cola, cured meat, balsam, dried herb, tobacco and leather.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made from 100% Cabernet, this is a worthy followup to the extraordinary 2006 and 2007 vintages. Feels fine in the mouth, with rich tannins and dry, elegant flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and French oak. The tannins are pure Napa, smooth and complex. Not ready to drink now, but give it a good six years, and it could develop over the next fifteen.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a beautiful wine with opulent aromas of chocolate fudge, cherry, vanilla bean and bright berry fruit. Yet in the mouth, it's is very focused, with enough structure and acidity to promise a long future. The finish is silky and fine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello offers bright aromas with lively cherry, cola, humus, dark spice and pipe tobacco, as well as savory tones of beef bresaola and even a touch of white peppercorn. Impressive complexity. Elegant and streamlined on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark fruit aromas of cherry, blackberry and exotic spice comprise the bouquet. There's inky density, contrasted against delicate aromas of lead pencil, cola and cured meat. The wine is plush, rich and extracted, with dusty, firm tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: As imposing as the athlete himself, this is an impressive wine from the get-go, high in acidity and the resulting bright cassis and red berry fruit. It's nuanced in pretty ways, with peppercorn, herb and chalky tannins. Lingering on the palate, the structure suggests significant aging potential; enjoy from 2021\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Blue flower, truffle, underbrush and perfumed berry aromas lead the nose on this structured but elegant wine. Firm, polished tannins provide the framework for crushed Morello cherry, black raspberry, white pepper and menthol flavors. It delivers an enviable combination of structure and finesse. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vibrantly intoxicating wafts of varietal pepper and violets are complemented by gorgeous layers of blackberry, raspberry and smoky, gamy meat. The acidity marks the palate most, however, lifting the wine's denseness of concentration into a more complex and interesting place. Made in small quantities, this wine is ready to enjoy but will age through 2021, as well.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Deep and richly layered in red and black berries, this wine offers a mouthwatering, juicy core, supported by layers of firm tannins and full-bodied oak. Concentrated, it retains enough acidity to maintain balance and is drinking lovely now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light and floral, this subtle dessert wine is made from Scheurebe grapes, more often found in Austria than California. It provides this wine with fresh apricot and honey on the palate, lingering yet low enough in alcohol and power to be enjoyed as either ap\\u00c3\\u00a9ritif or digestif, its sweetness greatly restrained.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big and complex wine by Napa-turned-Paso winemaker David Galzignato. Dense aromas suggest ripe plums, black licorice, vanilla and mint. Flavors are juicy with purple fruits and grounded with herbs and mint, all hanging on an excellent tannic structure that's substantial but not pushy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A grippy, powerfully concentrated wine, this is rich and full bodied in every way. It packs dense heaps of tobacco leaf with tar and baked, almost dried plum. A luxurious, decadent quaff from a Calistoga-based producer, it shows the vintage well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's no shortage of ripeness in this single-vineyard, somewhat hot and wild Toro. The nose is all spice, heat and simmering black fruit, and that's backed by a brooding, heaviy concentrated palate. Teetering on the precipice of overripe, this wine needs all the air and patience you can give it to muster elegance to match its power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful, velvet-textured wine, with its dense fruit, enticing and attractive. But the wine, from the 5-acre parcel owned by actor G\\u00c3\\u00a9rard Depardieu, is balanced, with a good layer of dry tannins, fresh acidity and subtle hints of the new wood used in the aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a small vineyard in St. Helena comes this ripe young wine, a Cab Franc-based Bordeaux blend. It's soft and forward, with cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate and cedar flavors that show Napa tannins at their smooth, ripe best. It's a little tight now, so give it a few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very rich in oak, with massive buttered toast, caramel and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9e flavors. The underlying fruit is good, suggesting pineapples and ripe peaches, but misses a beat for all that winemaker intervention. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tedeschi is one of the most respected winemaking families in Valpolicella but recently (over the past three or four years), they have adopted a much sweeter\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and consequently more astringent\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094style of Amarone. It won't appeal to everyone, but the wine does offer bountiful aromas of dark fruit, herbs and green peppercorn.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers aromas of dill, wet leaves, hay, pickled beets, roasted coffee bean and spearmint. The palate lacks fruit richness, delivering instead espresso and vanilla-sweetened oak. Astringent tannins generate a tongue-drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rose and violet aromas sit comfortably with tight, gritty cherry and plum scents. A tight medium-to-full palate is the staging ground for fresh plum and berry flavors that are powerful but not heavy. A long, warming finish maintains the wine's core potency. This is not ready to drink; best from 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Like an ugly duckling that's a beautiful swan in waiting, this unique ros\\u00c3\\u00a9, if you can call it that given its rusty, almost brown color, is something only Terroir Al Lim\\u00c3\\u00adt would bottle. Earthy in aromas, this mix of several Grenache strains tastes of apricot and dried red fruits. It's mildly spicy throughout, with actual tannins from skin contact. Drink this quasi ros\\u00c3\\u00a9 as you would a serious white or red, meaning with good food like a Catalan-style rice dish. And drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very opulent bottling by Steve Martell, who blends 83% Syrah, 16% Grenache and 1% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre to deliver aromas of black-plum sauce, hot licorice, hoisin and buttery pie crust. Rounded milk chocolate flavors show on the sip, melted atop the rich and ripe core of black cherry and cassis. It's a tad hot on the tongue.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is dense with fine concentration and a solid dry tannin character at the back. It is full of black fruits and balanced acidity. Its richness reflects the quality of the vintage and its aging potential. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: rich, fruity wood-aged wine, this offers ripe white fruits and plenty of smoky toast flavors. Acidity and minerality give the wine its distinctive tangy texture. These elements result in a ripe wine that will age further. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe wine, soft on the normal tannins of this appellation and big on the black-cherry and berry fruits. It does have a firm core, cushioned by the generous fruitiness. Drink this wine from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heavy oak gives off sawmill aromas, with only touches of apple and stone-fruit scents lurking below the surface. This feels creamy, heavy and striving for balance. With a ton of oak flavor leading the charge, it tastes woody, candied and spicy, but also jumbled and unfamiliar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Softly scented notes of apricot compote entice the nose. The palate is honeyed and pliable, with layers of sweetness and richness. Fresh lemon oil acidity holds against that but overall accentuates the honeyed apricot notes that are the chief theme of this luscious wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An unusual blend dominated by Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with only ten percent Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark, rich and fruity, with cassis, blackcurrant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped in big, sturdy tannins. Too young to drink now, unless it's with an enormous dish like braised short ribs, but best left for four or five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Milk chocolate and sweet cherry aromas appear alongside cured meat and plump black fruit. This is a straightforward Brunello with a creamy, soft close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Montalcino's most historic estate, this pretty Rosso opens with a bright, ruby color and aromas of spice and forest fruit. It delivers bright acidity and silky tannins in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a 100% Cabernet Sauvignon that's shy on the nose and softly approachable on the palate. Herbal and dry, it is couched in solidly built tannin and weight, with leathery graphite and cedar pronouncing themselves around a full body.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dense, tannic and concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, this conveys boysenberry and anise among the thick walls of structure and intensity that give this wine full-bodied flavor. Let it open and enjoy with hearty fare.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh, alluring aromas of wild berry, pressed violet, dark baking spice and a whiff of new leather all come together in the glass. The firm full-bodied palate offers ripe black cherry, mature plum, cinnamon, licorice and a hint of tobacco. Chewy tannins and bright acidity provide support and balance. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mont\\u00c3\\u00a9e de Tonnerre is considered one of the richest premier crus in Chablis, and this wine lives up to that reputation. It's ripe and full of yellow fruit, while maintaining its acidity and tight texture. Still young, its intense fruit and crispness will allow it to age for many years. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Young vines give this wine a bright, fruity character, while wood aging brings out complexity and ripe yellow and citrus fruits. It's juicy and lively, with just the right minerality and tight texture to allow it to age. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dark-skinned berry, culinary spice and a balsamic aroma come together on this polished red. The juicy palate gives ripe black cherry, star anise, clove and a hint of espresso alongside firm but refined tannins that lend structure and a smooth texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This viscous wine offers an underlay of toasty oak notes that round out its gravelly texture. Light-bodied and filigreed with acidity, its lemon, quince and fig flavors remain fresh and vibrant on the palate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This premier cru, surrounded by grand cru vineyards, has produced a luscious, ripe wine. It's generous in both black fruit flavor and structure, showing great potential for aging. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Mature black plum, tobacco, crushed violet, cake spice and toast aromas mingle together in the glass. The taut full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, orange peel and licorice alongside a backbone of close-grained tannins. This is still extremely young and tightly wound, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of baked plum, espresso, dark spice, leather and a balsamic note lead the way. On the chewy full-bodied palate, bracing tannins support juicy cherries marinated in spirits, raspberry, orange zest, licorice and tobacco. Fresh acidity lends balance. It still needs years to come around. Drink 2022\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, coconut, burned rubber and scorched earth lead the nose. The rather lean palate offers vanilla, licorice and a confectionary note while astringent tannins dry out the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a soft, earthy wine, with dried herb and currant flavors. It comes down on the subtle side, with a bit of oak influence adding richness to the wine's otherwise dry texture. Drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Overlooking the Gualala River and Pacific Ocean, the McDougall Vineyard reaches elevations of 1,100 feet, a perfect vantage point from which to breathe in fresh, cooling coastal air. The resulting wine is awash in bright, vibrant acidity, yet offers equal measures of juicy black cherry fruit and dried herb spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opening with a rich, luxurious nose, this wine is delightfully bright on the palate before evolving into brooding notes of black cherry and smoky oak. Hints of dark chocolate and coconut shavings round out the intrigue and complexity. The wine is ready to enjoy now, but worth cellaring through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Scott Hawley delivers deep and dark aromas of blueberry and mint against a backdrop of bacon fat and barrel smoke. The mouthfeel is rich and lush, with more blueberry plus anise, black licorice and a canvas of minty herbs that also reveal a touch of bitterness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of black currant, blue flower, tilled soil, menthol and cedar take center stage. The dense palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha, vanilla, nutmeg and a confectionery note. Velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense blueberry and black-cherry aromas mix with black pepper, lavender and violets on the nose of this blend of 62% Primitivo, 29% Syrah and 9% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre. The palate is a bit reserved, but offers blackberry, pepper, dried fennel, bay leaf and thyme flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a rich, smoky red-fruit-flavored wine. One of three wines produced by the estate that was created by the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy, it is made from biodynamically grown grapes. Wood aged, it shows spice as well as the cool fruitiness that gives the wine both its crispness and aging potential. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe, smoky and generous wine. It has spice and wood flavors that are balanced with the red berry and cherry fruits and the crisp acidity of the vintage.

The palate has a lightly creamy feel, showing a lot of freshness and tension.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Baked plum, forest floor, dark spice and resin are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied wine. The firmly structured palate offers dried cherry, fig, clove, anisette and tobacco while assertive, close-grained tannins give the finish grip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in a drink-me-now style, this is a delicately balanced wine, rich in oak, with a wealth of raspberries and cherries. It's soft, delicious and a little high in alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This soft, gentle Cabernet doesn't have much structure, but it's rich in blackberry, currant and dark chocolate flavors, and thoroughly dry. The finish is hot like a jalape\\u00c3\\u00b1o pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In the past, there was much more red wine than white wine produced in Chassagne-Montrachet. This firm, tannic wine, with its austere fruit, shows a similarity to Pommard. This is a wine that needs to age for over several years in order for it to soften and become round, and for the red berry fruit to surface.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Villa Spinosa owns some of the most beautiful vineyards in Valpolicella and selects the best fruit for this intense, succulent Amarone. The nose offers notes of milk chocolate, vanilla-cherry and spice as well as warmer tones of white mushroom, earth and baked apple. The mouthfeel is subdued, but balanced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Le Ragose makes Classico and non-Classico Amarone.

It has great length on the finish, firm tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This proprietary blend combines 52% Cabernet Franc, 34% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, another in its line of Aaron Pott-made wines.

Dusty, soft tannins support a full-bodied, straightforward structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, stewed prune, raisin and a balsamic note lead the nose. The mature straightforward palate offers raspberry jam, black cherry extract and anise alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Villero is a bright and traditional wine with a lean, compact appearance and sharp aromas of small berries, almond and anise seed. It's a well-defined wine with firm, tight tannins and a cooling menthol-like finish. Drink after 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Barolo Parafada is a very ripe expression of Nebbiolo with thick aromas of chocolate, raspberry, blueberry jam and cola that suggest hot growing conditions. The wine does have balance and structure though, especially in the mouth where firm tannins leave a lasting impression.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas on this Barbaresco from the Roncaglie cru are perfumed and fragrant and recall bee's wax, lavender, potpourri, violet, anise, cinnamon and ginger. This is a delicate and feminine expression with sour notes of cherry and wild berry on the close and firm, dusty tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 15-acre Castellero vineyard farmed by Fratelli Barale lies directly northeast of the town of Barolo.

It's a youthful and fun interpretation with firm tannins and a long, drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in a lighter, slightly more rustic and less ripe manner, with herb-infused black currant and licorice flavors. A vigorous young 100% Cab elaborated with plenty of new oak. Drink now through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barbaresco offers remarkable aromatic intensity and complexity that takes the form of white chocolate, small red berries, cola, road tar and red licorice. Based on the boldness of the nose, you'd expect the mouthfeel to be pulpy and fat. Instead, it is elegantly linear and tightly packed.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is fresh, crisply fruity and toasty without missing the apple and pear flavors that give juiciness behind the texture. It's ripe and is developing well. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine offers tropical fruit against a background of intense acidity. That makes it fruity, ripe with a tight structure that gives delicious lift and freshness.

The round palate doles out dried apricot and tangerine while a hint of orange blossom honey backs up the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Incredibly sweet, with caramelized brown sugar flavors of blackberries and chocolate, this dessert wine tastes a bit like an easy Port. It's made with traditional Port varieties, with California additions of Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon. Turns quick and simple on the finish, so drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Savigny-l\\u00c3\\u00a8s-Beaune often shows the softer side of Pinot Noir. This wine has juicy red-cherry and raspberry flavors that balance the gentle, dry tannins. The low-yielding old vines from which the fruit was sourced give this selection extra concentration. This will benefit from medium-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is Swanson's top Cabernet, which includes a splash of Merlot. As always, it's rich, tannic and dry, and it possesses a deep core of blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems more tannic and sharp than in previous vintages, which suggests its ageability. Try holding it until 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: La Fornace is a dark, savory expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that shows aged tertiary aromas of dark spice, cured meat and prune. It feels rich and dense, with a gritty quality to the tannins and long endnotes of bacon, black pepper and leather. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its upfront, ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine is immediately attractive. Behind the fruitiness, there is a firm, structured character of minerality and a steely edge, which makes this a Chardonnay to age for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An old-vine wine, this is powerful, concentrated and impressively dense for a Marsannay. It is full of red plum and berry flavors, plus firm tannins that suggest this could age for several years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Distinctive notes of black cherry, chopped mint, rosemary oil and eucalyptus open the nose of this Merlot. The lush, chewy and rich palate shows a lot of personality and pairing potential. Try drinking this with grilled steak with green peppercorn sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another excellent Idus. The nose is jammed full of big berry, leather and earth aromas. In the mouth, it's pure to the hilt, with jammy depth and delicious flavors of blackberry, chocolate and licorice. Finishes toasty and creamy, with soft tannins and ease. Drink now through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Corbaia is a super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon that opens with intensity and bright fruit flavors. It boasts a soft, silky feel with a firm tannic bite followed by cassis, earth and wild mushroom. Very nice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gorgeous, soft and rich with velvety firm tannins, Balifico would pair with spicy marinated pork or slow cooked-beef. The plushness is what sets this wine apart as do its fine aromas of blackberry, leather and black cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Baked, earthy, minerally berry fruit aromas suggest lead pencil, roasted plum, cassis and raspberry. The palate is lush, pure and balanced, with classic Priorat flavors of mineral-tinged blackberry and plum. Chunky and smooth on the finish, with broad, soft tannins. There's no bite or harshness at all; drink now through 2014.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Suisassi is one of Italy's most interesting and unique expressions of Syrah. Made according to organic and biodynamic principles, the wine shows a hearty masculine side of ripe fruit and rich oak that is enhanced by subtle elegance and lingering power. It is definitely worth your attention.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a beautiful, ripe and floral wine. It does have structure although the main focus is on the rich, juicy fruit. Berries and red plums push through the rounded tannins. It will age magnificently, with great richness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big, juicy and smoky, this powerful wine comes from vines in the center of the vineyard. Black fruits and firm tannins dominate the richness of the wine with its dark structure and concentration. A touch of chocolate and licorice partners with the generous fruits. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a vineyard surrounded by Grand Crus. It delivers a huge, smoky palate that is firm with tannins and dense with structure and fruit. The wine is rich, still shot through with the freshness of the vintage. Black fruits are balanced by the dry core of the wine. It will age well, and should not be drunk before 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ripe and generous, this floral wine is dense with fruit as much as tannins. It is full of blackberry and plum flavors, ripe while also cut with acidity. The spice that comes from the wood aging shows well, adding a further element. Drink the wine from 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is already well balanced. Ripe strawberries and red cherries are shot through with the acidity of the vintage. The tannins are present, complementing the already attractive fruits. The aftertaste shows the considerable potential with its tannins. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Steely and tight, this is a mineral-driven wine. With its vibrant acidity and tense texture, it is a classic Chardonnay that will fill out slowly and evolve favorably with time. Beneath the tension and forward acidity is a rich wine, though it needs time to show it. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This calmly seductive wine has a deep, dark color, absolutely gorgeous fruit, wood smoke and baking spice aromas and a gentle texture that lets all the berry, black-cherry and pomegranate flavors soak into the taste buds. While quite full-bodied, it's easy on the tongue but does have an extra fine-grained wrapping of tannin to keep it firm. Best from 2020 through 2030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rich wine from several parcels of vines in the Clos de Vougeot. It has great intensity, powered both by tannins and by the dark black fruits. Serious and concentrated, the wine will age magnificently. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: One-quarter of the Clos des Mar\\u00c3\\u00a9chaudes is classified Grand Cru, as the soil and the slope change. This shows in the power of the wine with its smoky tannins and dark character. Black fruits and a dense texture signify a wine with power and longevity. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged in small oak barrels, Ripasso La Traversagna most definitely shows a worldly, sophisticated side that is marked by aromas of exotic spice, clove and mature berry. That cool crispness on the close holds the wine firmly together.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very, sweet, with molasses, oatmeal cookie, blackberry jam, chocolate, vanilla and spice flavors. Could be more concentrated for the sweetness. The blend is mainly Petite Sirah, with the balance comprised of traditional Port varieties.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the far away 2002 vintage, this aged Amarone delivers tertiary aromas of polished mineral, ash, dried fruit, soy sauce and ginger chips. There's a pungent point of dried apple skin at the end. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeously light coastal offering, a subdued expression of the variety that unravels its layers slowly and methodically. Red cherry, lavender and blueberry are revealed on the palate as perfumed shocks of rose and salty air permeate the nose. Vibrantly crisp, it has a slight grip to the velvety texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky, dark aromas of minty blackberry, tobacco, black coffee and toast are complex and lead to a tight bullish palate with fierce tannins. Dark, toasty flavors of black fruits and dark chocolate finish grabby but with freshness and a sense of purity. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932034.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the producer's inaugural offering of the variety, made in tiny amounts, but boy oh boy, it's good. Bright blue and black-berry succulence exude vibrancy and freshness on the palate complemented by savory hints of tar, black licorice and char. Velvety soft tannins allow the fruit to speak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pure but restrained violet, plum and berry aromas are on the money. This feels racy but also saturated, with kick as well as commendable overall balance. Flavors of plum, ripe tomato, schist and spice finish smooth, peppery, herbal and slightly warm, with a note of coffee. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This small, estate-grown red from the eastern edge of St. Helena shows meticulous care taken both in the vineyard and cellar, with its remarkably soft, integrated tannin, especially in this warm, ripe vintage. Given just 2% Petit Verdot, it shines in black pepper, black cherry and a tiny suggestion of vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a lovely, 100% varietal wine, balanced between savory, almost sanguine meaty notes, and complex layers of cassis, plum and blueberry. Medium bodied with an elegance at its core, it has streaks of subtle cinnamon that give spiciness, and a finish dusted in Mexican chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the mighty Hyde in Carneros, this medium-bodied white blossoms with tropical fruit and briny minerality, a forceful combination that gives this wine both power and elegance. Textured in candied Meyer lemon, it finishes crisply and the right kind of sour.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas suggesting hazelnut, toast and a whiff of oak. The palate offers charcuterie, cooking spice and grilled herb but there's not much fruit here.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toast, licorice and espresso that follow through to the palate along with a green note of powdered sage. It lacks fruit richness while clenched, abrasive tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard-designate Barolo offers soapy, floral notes of lavender and church incense with more spice and nutmeg at the back. The wine is broad, chewy and well-structured with solid tannins and a densely concentrated texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With crushed strawberry and caramel flavors, this is relatively light wine, though elegant and pierced with acidity. Milk chocolate and soft tannins complete an attractive ensemble.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of Barbaresco's most celebrated vineyard crus, this ruby-colored wine exhibits loads of intensity and power in the form of cherry, cassis, leather, tar and cola. The wine's compact, tonic mouthfeel would make a great companion to rich, sophisticated cuisine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In a departure from the fuller, riper style exhibited last vintage, this edition of Barbaresco Santo Stefano shows thorny, brambly elements of white cherry and forest floor. In the mouth, it shows tight astringency and not too much heft or supporting density. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Compact and traditional with a bright, streamlined style, this pretty Barolo represents a blend of Nebbiolo grapes from two very important vineyard crus (the very structured Brunate and the elegant Le Coste vineyards).\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an interesting and potentially very beautiful wine that probably needs many more years of cellar aging before it is fully formed. At this young stage it shows raw notes of rhubarb, cola and spice backed by dark licorice overtones. It's drying and tight with jackhammer tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Still very closed up, this austere wine has distinct aging potential, with its taut character, apple skin texture and hints of wood. It will need 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years to show its best.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This hearty Barbera d'Alba exhibits a dark, toasty style with rich layers of generous fruit, blueberry and sweet Christmas spice. The oak element is evident and helps to tame the wine's natural sharpness and acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, both grown at the terrific Kick Ranch hillside site, this wine has a robustness of dark cherry and a red-brick color, soft, smooth and youthful in its seamless tannin and oak. Juicy dark blueberry and a touch of meaty spice form an enviable combination just ready for meaty dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toast, roasted herb, dark-skinned berry, mint and a balsamic note lead the way. The young, firm palate offers dark cherry, black raspberry and white pepper framed in austere tannins and bright acidity. It's still young and needs to unwind. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Molly Lyman takes a delicate approach to this 100% varietal estate wine, from a longstanding vineyard in the Chiles Valley. From a block named for a farming family linked to the site, Las Flores is sanguine in cranberry and graphite, food-friendly, with a lightness despite its pronounced plum, cassis and oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From an 850-foot-elevation site four miles from the ocean, this offers a depth of dark cherry and Asian spice, lightly bodied and textured. It delivers a hit of bittersweet chocolate on the tangy finish, with an intriguing streak of charcuterie that's hard to shake.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Needs time in the cellar, as it's really tough in tannins now. Feels hard and sandpapery and raspingly dry. Deep down inside is a molten core of ripe blackberries and black currants, with lots of new, smoky oak. Seems to be your classically ageable Napa red. Give it until at least 2013, and it could surprise and delight for many years beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak. Acidity is quite high, and plays a role in the way it tingles and cleanses the mouth. There's a fresh, jammy quality that makes the wine taste younger than its almost three years. Should develop in the bottle through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a unique Pinot Noir, different from almost everything else out there. Sourced from a vineyard in the Petaluma Gap region (perhaps a future AVA), it's bone dry, moderate in alcohol, and tannic. It has lighter, leaner flavors than most Pinots, with the fruit accompanied by herbs, minerals, flowers and mushrooms. Fans of super-fruity Pinots will find it unrich, but Burgundy lovers may think of Pommard. It will be fascinating to track this wine's progress.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark, bold, and full-bodied, this is the perfect embodiment of power and breed in a full-on (five grape) Bordeaux blend. Boysenberry, cassis, plenty of acidity\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the nose promises a great deal, though it is reticent in the mouth, and fairly acidic. This is a wine to lay down and enjoy in a decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The relatively unknown Pezerolles Vineyard is at the far northern end of Pommard, touching Beaune above Les Epenots. It produces wine that seems softer than many Pommards, with rich fruit, the tannins firm but definitely playing second fiddle. It is the smoky plum fruit with just a dash of acidity that makes this immensely pleasing.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With its sweet wood, dense fruit and jammy character, this is a rich wine. It has some solid tannins, but they are almost lost in the welter of soft strawberry, nutmeg and juicy red berries. Typically with 2005, this is a wine whose opulence appeals now, but those tannins do suggest some good aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light in color, this rejoices in its perfumed character as much as its fruit. There is a heady smoky aroma, while the palate shows a leaner character. The fruit flavors of red berries are given an extra dimension by the smoky wood and the meaty edge.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft, sensuous, this is a wine that appeals straight away to the senses. The red fruits float over a soft texture of sweet tannins, leaving a juicy, succulent texture. While it is not a powerful wine, it offers all the delicious characters of Pinot Noir.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toast, oak, grilled herb and a hint of iris. The palate offers coffee, marinated cherry, licorice and a saline note alongside close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Angels is made from a majority of Merlot, the balance nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, clove and a whiff of Dr Pepper give it a spiciness that's also fruity, while a softness of texture and medium body maintain approachability.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of coffee, toast, licorice and a slight whiff of cellar floor lead the way. On the ripe, dense palate, anise and baking spice accent black raspberry and wild cherry. Firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework while a hint of orange zest signals the close. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this mountain-grown wine offers bold black plum and berry around a compacted, extracted fullness of tannin and French oak. Dried herb, clove and vanilla accent the fruit, while the finish lingers gingerly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, resin, spiced plum and incense aromas lead the nose on this robust red. The chewy brawny palate delivers black cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, nutmeg and pipe tobacco while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. Drink 2017 through 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of resin, spiced plum, blue flower and a whiff of pipe tobacco float out of the glass. The smooth brawny palate presents dried black cherry, prune, vanilla, mocha and cinnamon framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is 81% Cabernet Sauvignon, 11% Petit Verdot and 8% Merlot, coming from Seven Hills, Loess and Mill Creek Upland vineyards. Light aromas of toast, barrel tones, flowers, licorice and dark fruit are followed by earth and other savory flavors that are light but still show weight and density.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alluring aromas of mature dark berry, leather, Asian spice and a whiff of fragrant purple flower slowly take shape in the glass. The palate has weight and precision, doling out dried cherry, prune, espresso, anise and pipe tobacco. Firm, fine-grained provide polished support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is soft, with attractive, aromatic red fruits. It has the round, ripe feel typical of the village, with just a tannic touch to keep it together. At the moment, the wine is all fruit and acidity, and it needs to develop further to bring out its secondary flavors. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine balances intense fruit with a steely core of minerality. It is packed with apple, crisp pear and kiwi fruits, contrasted with this tight texture and hints of wood aging. Well balanced, the wine will be ready to drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured, tight wine has complex almond and spice flavors that partner with crisp acidity and tangy lemon zest and grapefruit accents. The texture with its minerality and tight aftertaste promises aging. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cured meat, leather, underbrush, blue flower and toast aromas lead the nose while the tight palate offers tart red cherry, baking spice and dried herb. Firm, close-grained tannins provide structure while a hint of star anise closes it down.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opens with pretty aromas suggesting perfumed berry, leather, violet and menthol. The soft, accessible palate offers crushed black cherry and licorice framed in supple tannins. It isn't complex, but it is delicious and already approachable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rather lean and austere, this is a tight, structured wine. Its future lies in the firm tannins and the juicy red-currant fruit. Wait for this wine and don't drink before 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The last vintage from vines planted in 1936, this offers aromas suggesting toast, oak, vanilla, forest floor, graphite and a whiff of eucalyptus. The firm, concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, cranberry, game, and a note of exotic spice alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toasted aromas come along with fragrances of espresso, forest floor and woodland berries. The palate delivers raw red cherry layered with mocha and coffee bean alongside astringent wood tannins that generate a drying, bitter finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Whiffs of ripe black cherries, vanilla and spice, along with delicate hints of soil and barnyard, mark this unusual blend of Saperavi and Sereksiya grapes. Tart black-fruit flavors accented with swathes of fresh herbs are a bit lean on the palate, but the acidity is gentle. It's dry and easy drinking in style with smooth, gentle tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine leads off with aromas of mint, spearmint, espresso, oak and red berries. The palate shows cherry, coffee, cooking spices and espresso alongside drying wood tannins. It lacks the fruit richness and structure that one expects from Brunello.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is rather inexpressive and already evolved. The nose reveals red and black berries accented with notes of black pepper that carry over to the palate. It's one dimensional and tightly tannic.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stewed black fruit, prune, raisin, espresso and exotic spice aromas lead the nose on this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc. The densely concentrated palate is dominated by toasted oak, grilled bell peppers and notes of black plum, all sweetened up with coffee, dark chocolate and sugary vanilla extract. It closes on a note of bitter wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this dense wine features aromas of black plum, bell pepper, cedar, mocha and toasted oak. The palate is driven by very evident oak, chocolate, vanilla and concentrated, almost sugary, blackberry. The sweetness is broken up by an astringent, drying note of wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft in tannin and oak, this wine shows a cool-climate profile, its grapes sourced largely from Mount Veeder's mountainous terrain. Blackberry pie, cedar and crushed herb combine nicely alongside integrated power and full-bodied concentration.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This proprietary blend combines 52% Cabernet Franc, 34% Merlot and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon, another in its line of Aaron Pott-made wines. It's lovable in its austerity and varietal suggestions of dried herb, cedar and green bean. Dusty, soft tannins support a full-bodied, straightforward structure.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Red berry, cedar and light spice aromas lead the way on this dazzling red. The vibrant palate is loaded with finesse, delivering bright red currant, red raspberry, white pepper and chopped herb alongside bright acidity and firm, polished tannins.

Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A designation used only when a vintage deserves, this reserve is definitely worthy. Almost a decade after bottling, it offers an intensity of chocolate, cinnamon and clove against soft, mellowed and structured tannin. Dusty sage and a bramble of blackberry complete the picture. It may have another five to seven years of beauty left within, but why wait?\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Pinot Nero opens with candied aromas of raspberry, citrus and wild strawberry, followed by a lean but fresh feel on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by strong, ripe fruit, this Cab is a bit one-dimensional.

It may need time to come around, its sheer weight impressively wrapped in blackberry and blueberry jam.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Amarone boasts black cherry and plum flavors layered with notes of toasted oak, black pepper and chocolate.

Cabernet Sauvignon constitutes 11% of the blend, but the wine still shows that Cabernet Franc, by itself or almost nearly, needs something more to give it extra oomph.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While this wine is rich, its tight texture brings out the minerality. Yellow fruits and toast are balanced with zingy acidity for a wine that will need time to broaden out.

It has lean flavors of strawberries and raspberries and new French oak. The wine isn't showing well now, seemingly a victim of the harsh vintage. Its future is problematic.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A structured wine, it has the weight and the firm tannins to give it aging potential.

The acidity remains vibrant, but drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark chocolate notes join acidity and ripe black fruit flavors. The wood is dominant in this relatively soft wine, although the fruit juiciness comes through well to finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Within a statement-sized bottle, this heavy, lush and aromatic Pinot Noir from a great vineyard could ignite debates about California Pinot styles. Aged about a year in all French oak, 65% of it new, it reveals an expanse of dark cherry fruit, velvety texture and plenty of structure amidst a leathery core and lengthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From old head-trained vines, Contention is McCay's top-of-the-line Westside Lodi Zin, a study in tight, dusty tannins and earthy acidity backed by a substantial layering of baking spices. Let this wine open a while to express itself fully.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Irresistible is the word that comes to mind to describe this Pinot, which is available only in magnums. The vintage was California's finest ever, and the wine shows spectacularly ripe red currant, cherry, tangerine zest, licorice and beef jerky flavors, with just the right touch of smoky oak. Yet the structural balance of acidity and fine tannins gives it the perfect architecture. Best now in its flashy youth and for the next 4 or 5 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Available only in magnums, this Chard consists of a single barrel from the estate vineyard, which is in the Petaluma area, a very cool region. The wine is very fine. It's equal parts ripe green pears, Meyer lemons and smoky oak, with a firm, steely underpinning of minerals. Should age well for a Chardonnay, especially in the big bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Supersweet, but never cloying, with acidity, pear skin tannins and delicate sweet brown sugar and honey flavors. It is a great example of how Loire Chenin manages to keep its balance and freshness while still offering long-aging botrytis character. Keep for at least 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a beautifully executed, amber-colored vin santo with pristine notes of dried fruit, honey, molasses and caramel. It doesn't have any of those resin-driven, smoky notes that you sometimes find and is instead very harmonious and clean in the mouth. It imparts a luscious, velvety feel that ends sweet and tart.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll appreciate the streamlined and compact character of this Cab-Merlot blend that ultimately helps establish its harmony and balance. In terms of aromas, it offers bright cherry fruit, forest berry, blueberry, spice and lightly toasted coffee bean. The oak element becomes more obvious in the mouth where the wine also showcases silky tannins and chewy fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance. Filled with flamboyant blackberry jam, cherry, cassis, licorice, chocolate and smoky vanilla-oak flavors, it appeals immediately to the tastebuds, but has the tannin-acid balance to age for a decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full and ripe, certainly as befits Meursault from a great year, but this wine also has deliciously crisp acidity which adds an element of minerality, of poise, to the smooth toast and cream texture. An enticing, structured wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This  blend of Cab, Sangiovese and Merlot has a fruity, almost sweet nose that recalls almond paste or Amaretto, with tones of blueberry and raspberry in the background. It's a fruitier, more immediate wine with pretty renderings of oak and toasted nut in the background. It's also clean and elegant with good staying power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard Pinot Noir shows fine coastal acidity and dryness, and a transparency of taste that comes from the terroir. It's very delicious, with jammy raspberry and cherry fruit flavors enriched with oaky vanillins and smoky, buttery caramel. Gorgeous and compelling, combining power and nuance, it's a wine to drink now and through 2015, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, toast, espresso, peppermint and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose. The firm palate offers dark cherry, cake spice, grilled herb and anise alongside tightly wound, assertive tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is singer/songwriter John Legend's inaugural wine project in conjunction with Raymond Vineyards in the Napa Valley.

This is a wine of great presence.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with earthy aromas of game, underbrush and leather. The ripe palate offers dried cherry, fleshy raspberry, grilled sage, licorice and baking spice alongside bracing tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with Nero d'Avola and other grapes, all bush-trained, this opens with subdued aromas of dark berry and toast. The dense palate offers dried blackberry, oak-driven spice and a chocolate note alongside firm tannins. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the fruit flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Powerfully brambly this gigantic wine hails from a monumental vineyard that consistently delivers fine-tuned tension between structure and intensity. Sizable tannins surround a soft mouthfeel of plum, leather and black pepper, the concentration suggesting aging through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas of raisin, wet underbrush, anise, oak and dried herb on this. The firm palate is robust but lacks fruit richness, offering licorice, the heat of evident alcohol, roasted coffee bean and a suggestion of dried-up black cherry. It also has a green note of powdered sage while raspy tannins leave an astringent, mouth-puckering finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of dry underbrush, toast, oak and eucalyptus lead the nose. The palate is already quite evolved, offering dried red cherry, espresso and a hint of anise alongside close-grained tannins that dry out the rather abrupt finish. Drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with aromas of black cherry and caramel that follow through to the dense palate along with a hint of cedar. Clenching tannins leave a mouth-puckering finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy berry and raisin aromas announce a warm, ripe wine. This feels plump, grapy and chunky, with moderate acidity. Grapy, bold flavors of raspberry, prune and cherry are earthy and loamy, while ripeness and a raisiny element carry onto the finish. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a valley-floor site, this blend of 70% Zinfandel and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon delights in a depth of blackberry and cedar, reflecting well on both varieties. Firm tannin and restrained oak provide room for a touch of gun smoke and pencil lead, with a lengthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with simple fruit tones of cherry and cassis backed by evolved aromas of spice, leather and cola. It shows impressive purity and a long, silky finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Nervo Cru, this dark Barbaresco shows a slight edge in terms of concentration and aromatic intensity. Notes of dark fruit, hazelnut and roasted espresso bean compose the bouquet, and the wine delivers smooth softness on the finish. Those characteristics suggest that this may be ready to drink earlier than others.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tight and streamlined, this has fresh acidity, polished tannins and pretty aromatic highlights of dried berry, licorice and cured meat. It shows an elegant personality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a subdued but firm quality to this wine that also shows aromas of ripe fruit, cured meat, blackberry and cigar box. The palate shows bright freshness and velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a hint of strawberry at the start that soon segues to savory aromas of cured meat and spice. The ripeness translates to the mouth where there's a touch of cherry. Age for five more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of baked plum, mocha, toast and sweet pipe tobacco drive the nose while the palate offers palate offers dried black cherry marinated in spirits, vanilla, nutmeg and leather.

On the tightly wound palate, bracing tannins support raw cherry, anise, tobacco and a hint of coffee alongside firm acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of pressed violet, ripe berry, menthol and a touch of exotic spice emerge on this full-bodied red. Showing its hot-vintage origins, the firm palate doesn't boast a lot of fruit richness but offers licorice, espresso, powdered sage and dried cherry accompanied by bracing, grainy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers a classic Nebbiolo nose of rose petal, dark berry, tilled earth and a balsamic note. The lean palate shows sour red berry, grilled herb, clove and a hint of mocha on the finish. Tightly compacted tannins and brisk acidity need time to unwind. Drink after 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, tilled earth and gamey aromas lift out of the glass.

This will be ready to drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Structured and fruity, this has plenty of minerality to pair with the crisp citrus flavor. The wood influence gives it extra depth, while the crispness is preserved by a final steely thrust. This structured wine should age for four years or more\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Still very firm and closed, this is textured and rich, with intense mineral and wood flavors that balance the steeliness. It's full bodied, taut and nervy, with a concentrated core. Age for at least four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 100% Cabernet grapes grown in this highly regarded vineyard that straddles Atlas Peak, this is dry, full bodied and softly rich in tannins. It has a fruity essence and a toasty sweetness that's driven by the oak, making it delicious.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This boats balanced structure, density and alcohol, with pretty aromatic renderings of cherry and spice. It's not too thick and chewy, but rather polished. It would pair nicely with breaded Milanese veal chops.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opulent and very minerally, this is deeply flavored and concentrated, with a lively, crisp edge. It's fruity while also having a textured finish that shows a structured, age-worthy side.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While wood aromas are prominent now, this ultimately showcase the ripe red fruits that lie underneath.

The texture is smooth and polished, showing a touch of chopped mint.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lush and delicious, this is rich with complex berry, currant, cola, spice and cedar flavors. It's earthier and more rustic than the modern style of extreme softness and sweetness, but that's exactly what gives it such charm.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is rich, complex and full of ripe fruit. A firm structure underlies the richness, lending concentration and density. The fruit is still reticent and will show more generously in another year. Age for five years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Solid and powerful, with a very firm character, this shows the structured, concentrated side of the vineyard, with complex acidity cutting through the dark tannins. The wine is condensed and solidly based around a firm, dry core.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A small percentage of Sangiovese is added to this traditional Amarone blend, giving it balance and acidity.

On the palate, it tastes dry and richly textured.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Showing extreme elegance and finesse, this has notes of wild strawberry, cassis, Indian spice, cedar, molasses, licorice and even a touch of crushed granite. The mouthfeel is plush, rich and polished.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The extra year gives this wine quite different flavors from the forward fruitiness of Provence ros\\u00c3\\u00a9.

This is a serious, food friendly ros\\u00c3\\u00a9.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky, fiery initial aromas of cinnamon, baking spices, schist and red-berry fruits echo with licorice and minerality.

Imported by Superior Wines and Specialty Cellars.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard Barolo is fragrant, with violet, leather and underbrush aromas. The palate shows bright red-cherry flavors and layers of cinnamon and other spices. Despite the forward nature of the vintage, this actually needs a few more years to open up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is very young and needs time to come together. Currently, it's all about tart acidity and fresh, penetrating Dr. Pepper, cherry, pomegranate and oak flavors. It's elegant and complex, with the potential to develop for 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years, maybe longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Right out of the bottle, this single vineyard Pinot is rich. The flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar, are delicious and direct.

Give the tannins a few years to loosen up then drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and chewy, this starts with aromas of grilled porcini, underbrush, ripe dark fruit, dried herb and clove. Tightly packed tannins frame dried black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, ground pepper and licorice. You'll also feel the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate that throws it somewhat off-balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tan in color and in the early stages of fading, this smells reserved, with aromas of turpentine, popcorn and bread. Rubbery and slightly pinched in feel, this tastes briny, nutty and melony, with plenty of oak in support. A lighlty oaked finish is short in length and complexity. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Extremely ripe and concentrated, this opens with aromas that suggest charred earth, toast, cured meat and roasted coffee bean. The accessible, monolithic palate offers raspberry jam, chocolate-covered cherry and a hint of vanilla alongside mature tannins, with the warmth of evident alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bottling, from the winery's estate vineyard in the warm Pope Valley region, is ripe and relatively high in alcohol.

The tannins are thick and furry, suggesting aging for six or so years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Structured and elegant, this opens with aromas of blue flower, tilled earth, leather and a balsamic note.

The palate suggests a very flavorful pork roast in plum sauce, showing hoisin, ripe blackberries and grape candy, proving simultaneously playful and elegant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Farmhouse just-churned butter is most prominent on the nose, opening up a world that then flowers into layers of ripe, rich apple and pear. Balanced and textured, the wine reflects its near-ideal vintage, marked by a pronouncement of structure and power. Finishing with a zing, it will stand up to time in the cellar, through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From a half-acre parcel, this is a delicately structured wine.

There are some ripe fruit aromas of plum and prune as well and the wine fades slowly with a long, dusty finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a genuine and fresh expression of Barbaresco with loads of fruit-driven aromas including cherry, cassis, raspberry and fresh plum. There's great acidity and brightness too and the wine finishes with tart berry flavor on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Some superripe notes give this wine a raisin-skin bitterness, but there's no denying its immediate lushness. Softly tannic, it has fantastic flavors of black currants and sweet toasted oak. If you drink it now, give it a few hours in the decanter.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend has rich, pleasant cherry, currant and mocha flavors, enhanced with sweet toasty oak. A soft, luscious wine with a lot of popular appeal, it's drinking beautifully now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet is so approachable now.

The lean evolved palate shows roasted coffee bean, a hint of oak-driven spice and a salty note but the fruit has already dried up, leaving an abrupt, astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of blackberry, leather, coffee and scorched earth. On the palate, licorice, clove and a balsamic note add depth to the core of dried black cherry while fine-grained tannins provide the framework.

Dusty earthiness frames its green, vegetal flavors, wrapped in ripe, sturdy tannins and bitter leather and clove notes.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big, rich and complex, this is a Cabernet you want to lay down. Tasted in the late Fall of 2013, it's tannic, oaky and dry, brimming with spectacularly ripe blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors. The alcohol is a bit high, giving the wine some heat, and yet the balance is so good that the wine should easily develop over the next eight years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tasted in early December, this Cabernet, which was blended with Merlot and Petit Verdot, was in a funny place in its evolution. It's not exactly fresh and fruity, but it hasn't evolved to the complexity of an aged wine. You'll find plenty of restrained blackberry, cherry, currant, violet, oak and tannic notes that require another 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years to resolve and shine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Amazingly lush and delicious in blackberry and cherry pie, mocha and sweet new-oak flavors, this blend is also tannic to the point of being undrinkable at this time.

It's a delicious sipper.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This beautiful Cabernet has all the hallmarks of a wine that will go the distance. Tasted in late summer, 2013, at nearly four years of age, it's bright and fresh in black and red currants, mocha, licorice, baking spices and smoky sandalwood. But it's also quite tannic. The balance is superb, though, strongly suggesting further development through at least 2021. Expensive, yes, but it's right up there with Napa's best.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Already impressive, this wine shows great fruit for the vintage as well as structure. Ripe with black cherries and berries, it has all of Pinot Noir's rich juiciness, but hints of smoke add complexity as well. Structured and a shade dark, it needs time to mature. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a quintessential Franciacorta, featuring lovely aromas of pressed white flowers and citrus.

Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a tight, dry, tannic wine, showing all the hallmarks of ageabiity. Winemaker Philippe Melka has done a good job of blending fruit from Yountville, Atlas Peak and St. Helena to produce a seamlessly integrated Cabernet. The mouthfeel is soft, yet with fierce tannins that frame superb blackberry, cocoa, herb, mineral and cedar flavors.

Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Amarone sometimes benefits from a tiny dash of volatility (that usually comes across with aromas that resemble red apple or cider), but in this case those notes have turned to apple sauce and ultimately distract from the overall picture. The wine is chewy and bright in the mouth with firm tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Loads of purple fruit and baked goods show on the nose of this 36% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, 34% Grenache and 30% Syrah blend, reminiscent of blueberry pie and olallieberry-vanilla muffins. Flavors are plump and ripe, like blackberry cookie dipped in caramel-milk chocolate sauce.

An earthy sublayer keeps it complex and compelling.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The mighty Insignia shows a vibrancy of purpose and craft in this, its 40th vintage, combining 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Petit Verdot, 3% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc. Together they find a higher calling of perfumed violet, dark plum and berry along with graphite and an edginess of dried herb. Firm, structured tannins show tremendous potential for aging and decanting. This is a near-perfect effort from a blockbuster vintage.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from the vineyard that sits at the pinnacle of Chardonnay in Burgundy.

The wine is so generous and packed with fruit as well as a strong mineral texture. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Produced from less than half an acre of the Grand Cru vineyard, the wine has power and dark concentration.

The wine should not be drunk before 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas are perfumed and expressive, with notes of crushed flowers, brown stems, black olive, sea salt, smoked meat and funk.

This is open and and very joyous, fresh and utterly fruit-driven with a lasting, very moreish finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Traditional and bright with berry aromatics that really pop, Sesti's Brunello delivers a steady stream of cherry, cassis, dried ginger, leather and tobacco aromas. The acidity feels sharply etched in the mouth and the wine could use 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00937 years in the cellar to soften.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very characteristic of the 2008 vintage, this young Brunello opens with soft and round aromas of cherry and blackberry backed by delicate tones of spice and tobacco. Once the wine hits the palate, you will feel that bright acidity that is so typical of Sangiovese Grosso.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright cherry cola and black currant gives this Brunello a plump and fruity personality that is difficult to find in the wines of 2008. Those fruit notes are raw, bold and are followed by a soft touch of milk chocolate or vanilla. The wine shows a creamy, velvety texture with a point of acidity and alcoholic heat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Petit Verdot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend clearly wants some time in the cellar. Although it's extraordinarily rich with blackberries, black currants and violets, the tannin-acid structure is such that aging for at least ten years shouldn't be a problem.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of characteristic Cabernet flavor in this wine. Blackberrry jam and cassis liqueur flavors flood the mouth, heady and flashy and long in the finish. The tannins are thick, yet so soft, you can enjoy this wine now, although it will develop over the next ten years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Petite Sirah is very, very sweet. When the palate experiences this much concentrated brown sugar and caramel, it exults. The problem is that sweetness is pretty much all there is.

Beginning to dry out, so drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of forward fruit flavor in this ripe Cabernet.

Not particularly subtle, but it defines the modern style of Cabernet, and lots of people will love it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Impressive from the start for its rich blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, thick tannins and sweet overlay of smoky oak. Could be an ager, but some bitterness in the middle suggests the fruit will fall out before the tannins resolve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mint, dark-skinned berry and roasted coffee beans lead the nose. The concentrated palate delivers baked plum, mocha, blackberry, chopped herbs and a confectionary note alongside fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: For a Gevrey, this wine emphasizes softness rather than structure. It does have good depth of flavor and is full of acidity and red berry fruits. The wine offers pleasure now, while having medium-term aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cavallotto (Tenuta Bricco Boschis) offers a dark and powerful Riserva with a masculine, brooding personality complete with black spice, peppercorn, licorice, cola, prune and blackberry preserves. The wine concludes with a soft, velvety mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a tight and compact expression of Barolo with some meaty, earthy aromas at the back of berry fruit, cola and dried herbs. There is a lighter, more feminine side to the bouquet that is successfully contrasted against the bolder, thicker feel this wine imparts in the mouth.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Pure, generous, red cherry fruit scintillates over a structured wine that has dense tannins and texture. The whole is pierced with the dominant acidity of 2008.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in the modern cult style, this Cabernet is softly luscious, oaky and enormously rich.

A big, powerfully luscious wine that could pick up bottle complexities over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky aromas introduce a wine that is structured and concentrated, with intense fruit and acidity. Firm tannins, a subtle touch of wood and fine richness all combine mellifluously.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Marchesi di Barolo delivers a rich, concentrated expression from the Serragrilli cru with mature cherry and candied fruit aromas along with bright nuances of Spanish cedar, barbecue spice and cigar box. The wine is astringent at this young age, but has the pulp and heft for a long aging future. Drink after 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of almost equal parts Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon, supported by smaller percentages of Merlot, Malbec, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a sizable wine. A tight fist of dry wood tannins and tobacco carries a gamy, leathery touch to the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has aromas recalling chopped herb, red berry, dill, espresso and camphor. The lean vigorous palate offers sour cherry, cranberry, licorice and roasted coffee bean along with a green note of powdered sage. Grainy tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense and extracted, this opens with aromas that recall resin, prune, nutmeg and oak. On the palate, licorice, toast, espresso and tobacco accent black cherry extract. Firm but not overly persistent tannins offer support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, toast, mature plum, blue flower and spice lead the nose. The palate offers black cherry, vanilla, toasted oak and mocha alongside extremely astringent tannins that leave a tongue-drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard-designate Barbaresco features aromas of espresso, toasted oak and baked black fruit. The palate offers roasted coffee bean, vanilla and dried cherry alongside drying wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature plum, blackberry, toasted oak and vanilla carry over to the palate along with coffee and espresso. Raspy wood tannins give an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Basically good, with jammy berry flavors, but ultimately clumsy, especially for the price. Shows overripe fruit and green tannins. Feels sharp toward the finish. Not going anywhere, so drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Even though the alcohol is a high 15.3% abv, this Cabernet tastes like it still has some residual sweetness. It's as rich and ripe in blackberries, but awkward, and doesn't seem capable of aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Retaining a good sense of structure, this is also a relatively light and fresh Gevrey-Chambertin. It has plenty of raspberry and red plum flavors and lively acidity at the end. Drink from 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A ripe wine, this is full in the mouth and full of fruit. Apricots and lemons go well together for a rich while crisp mouthful. The wood aging over 18 months only shows fleetingly, leaving fruit as the main thrust. It finishes with plenty of fresh acidity. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of raisin, tobacco leaf, underbrush, grilled porcini mushroom and leather. The extracted palate delivers black pepper, clove, dried sage, prune and licorice supported by teeth-coating tannins. The heat of searing alcohol on the finish throws the wine off balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and fruity, this has an oak flavor that overshadows the blackberries and currants.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and gentle in structure, this Cab appeals for its ripe, pie-filling flavors of blackberries, cherries and spices. It's a pretty, polished young wine whose vigorous tannins give it a sandpapery texture. Ready now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of fragrant blue flowers, forest floor and perfumed berry lead the nose on this structured wine. The vibrant palate doles out juicy black cherry and crushed raspberry, while accents of vanilla, mocha and licorice add depth. It's nicely balanced, with fresh acidity and firm yet velvety tannins. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Drouhin has significant holdings in a number of top Chambolle vineyards. This wine is a blend from other Premier Crus in the same village. It has the typical generous character along with a more serious structured backbone that gives a dry and solid density that's worth aging. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Cabernet Franc from a sweet vineyard spot near Dalle Valle, this is a lovely, softly textured wine. Shy on the nose yet powerful on the palate, it offers a burst of tightly wound tannin and leather at the fore. Chocolate and dried herb with a layering of black licorice give it a dark complexion and build. Be sure to mellow it in the cellar, through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, crushed herb and blue flower. The palate is tightly wound and rather closed, showing hints of orange zest and raw cranberry. Racy acidity and austere tannins clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Bolgheri, what's fast becoming the Tuscan Gold Coast, this Cabernet Sauvignon (with 15% Sangiovese) offers complex aromas of bacon, rose hip and vanilla. The palate is more basic than one might expect, given the exclusive neighborhood it comes from. There's round plummy fruit and creamy oak. The chewy, weighty finish is filled with residual plum and cherry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, truffle and red berries take center stage in this intense blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo/Colorino. The palate delivers succulent black cherry, mint and menthol sprinkled with toasted notes and espresso. It has structure and finesse alongside gripping, tongue-drying tannins. Give this a few more years. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark in color, this powerful and concentrated wine is still very young. There is possibly too much extraction here that shows in bitterness, but the wine also has the potential for aging with its rich underlying fruitiness. Don't drink before 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard on Howell Mountain, the wine shows not only that area's hard tannins, but also the Duckhorn style of tough young Merlots. The wine is vastly rich in black and red currants, violets, anise and lavishly toasted new French oak. Start drinking it in 2017, and it should be going strong for an additional decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Visitors to Sonoma Valley are familiar with the beautiful Cherryblock Vineyard, which has been Sebastiani's flagship Cabernet source for decades. The 2010 vintage was kind to it, producing fruit that's not only exceptionally ripe, but well structured. Balanced acidity and soft, intricate tannins house luscious black cherry, currant, anise and new oak flavors. The wine should age in the bottle for at least eight years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 43% Merlot, 28% Malbec, 14% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc is the winery's star bottling of the vintage, offering aromas of plum, leather, sage, chocolate syrup and crushed breathmints.

The tannins could use a touch more mellowing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas recall nail polish remover, black cherry marinated in spirits and exotic spice. The thick palate delivers prune, mocha, dark chocolate and coffee bean alongside velvety tannins. It has a long finish and closes on a bitter, nutty note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a number of Premier Cru vineyards, the wine is solid and dark. Firm, dry tannins still dominate and give promise for aging. At the same time, black plum fruit flavors show a riper side and add richness to the mix. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of grapes from a number of Premier Cru parcels. It gives a rich, ripe and fruity wine with a good depth of flavor and strong signs of the wood aging. At this stage, the wood is leaving some bitterness and toast, but this will round out. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Definitely on the ripe side, this aged Cabernet offers aromas of green pepper, chocolate, vanilla bean and black cherry. It delivers a pretty, modern approach and a nice, gritty texture in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dazzling Merlot, rich and complex, offering immediately appealing waves of cherry pie, red currant, cola, mocha, brown sugar, cinnamon and sweet oak. Even though the tannins are thick, they're as soft as velvet.

Drink 2014 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tight, acidic and dry in youth, this Pinot has a don't-drink-me-now austerity. It resists efforts to break it down at every point. However, it seems well able to age, given the balance, and the wealth of cherry, pomegranate, persimmon and rhubarb fruit. Cellar this fine wine until at least 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a warm, yeasty quality to this bright sparkling blend (with Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) from northern Italy. It is redolent of apricot, toasted almond, freshly baked bread and dried roses. In the mouth, it shows a drying feel and piquant, fresh bubbling.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful wine that has plenty of weight and also a firm structure of minerality to go with the yellow fruits that are now evolving into more mature flavors. It is by no means at its peak yet. Give it 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This small property with its own ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau lies within the lower portion of Vaud\\u00c3\\u00a9sir but is considered a Grand Cru in its own right. The wine\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the flagship of the cooperative\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094is opulent, showing strong wood aging flavors that will soften with time. Ripe and generous with yellow fruit flavor, it also boasts a tight mineral acidity and crispness, making it a good candidate for cellaring. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a stunning, vibrantly robust and intense wine, big, bold and reductive and blended with 3% Petite Sirah. Floral aromas take on meaty, gamy overtones amidst black licorice, tar and juicy strawberry, the tannins silky and supportive and the finish leathery and spicy.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Red chewy fruit that's succulent and satisfying defines this wine that takes a straightforward approach to oak and tannin, integrating them both well. Cherry and cassis linger on the sizable finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, citrus and a floral note lead the nose on this racy sparkler. The vibrant palate shows sour cherry, tangerine and pastry cream alongside refreshing acidity and a vivacious perlage. A walnut note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barbaresco opens with aromas of French oak, coconut, dark fruit and a dash of exotic spices. The firm palate offers cranberry, roasted coffee bean and oak-driven spice alongside bracing tannins that tightly grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the wines produced to celebrate the family's 500-year history, this is intensely herbal, with taut and highly textured minerality. It tastes of the chalk soil with its zesty flavor, bursting out of the glass. Drink this still young wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and thick kirsch aromas meet with a minty chocolate lift on the nose of this bottling from one of the most important producers in Temecula, where the winery's influence is unparalleled. The warmer climate influence is dialed back expertly on the palate, allowing herb-laced black-plum and berry fruit to shine, decorated with lavender and bay leaf.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very dry at the start, this opens up well to give a rich and fruity wine. The tannins are still powerful and show that the wine needs to age. With licorice and smoky flavors, the wood element is still very present. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Col d'Orcia's straight Brunello starts with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature black fruit, leather and a hint of grilled herbs. The ripe, forward palate offers black raspberry and dark cherry layered with notes of milk chocolate and coffee. It's soft, round and very accessible, so enjoy sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Structured but accessible, it opens with aromas of mature black cherry, raisin, leather, cake spices and coffee. The round, soft palate delivers fleshy black plum, cinnamon, clove and licorice layered with a milk chocolate note. It's not the most complex Brunello out there but it has succulent fruit and firm tannins. Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A smooth, rich wine, it is just losing its flavors of wood aging and developing its black fruit flavors to show the opulence of the vintage. Structure and a solid texture frame the ripe fruit. It could still age, so wait until 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opening aromas include black berries, toast and underbrush with whiffs of leather and eucalyptus. The palate delivers fleshy black cherry accented with vanilla, black pepper and coffee alongside dusty tannins. It closes on a sweet note of almost overripe fruit and is fast approaching its ideal drinking window.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This brooding wine starts with aromas that recall underbrush, overripe black fruit, mint, iris and baking spices. The palate is tightly knit, with ripe red fruit, black pepper and black spices alongside solid tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows nice blackberry, cocoa and cedar flavors, and is properly dry. But there's some green unripeness, and a clunky edge to the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tough in tannins and dustily dry, this is a hard wine to warm up to. It's not just the astringency but the absence of fruit. Shows modest flavors of cherries and blackberries, and doesn't seem like an ager. A disappointment.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 100% Merlot, this is a sort of junior, less expensive version of Blackbird's Illustration bottling. It's ripe in cherries and forward in smoky oak, with charred wood dominating the fruit. Feels simple and candy sweet in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thick, ripe and jammy, this is an explosive wine, broadly rich and rewarding in black-cherry, berry and licorice layers of flavor. Firm, tight tannins offer structure and power, with an intriguing hint of fennel funneling through.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from one of the few white-wine vineyards in Vougeot. It is opulent and rich with creamed apple and ripe green plums. The fruit lies over the subtle wood aging that has smoothed the crisp texture. The wine is still young and will be best from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's aromas suggest black fruit, minerals, dark plum, barrel spice and kirsch. Its black fruit flavors are sweet and sappy, augmented with toasty barrel notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Co-fermented with 5% Roussanne, this wine comes from Morrison Lane Vineyard. It's brightly aromatic, with blueberry jam, huckleberry and spice notes. The palate is soft and textured, delivering rich fruit flavors and a long finish that shows some warmth.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This dense wine is still very young. The fruit still needs to express itself in a wine that is broad and ripe. Give this rich wine, with its creamy texture and touches of spice from wood aging, until 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is rather closed but eventually reveals red berry, rose, cake spice and a whiff of leather. It's young but balanced, with bracing tannins and bright acidity that support the tart sour cherry, white pepper and sage flavors. It closes on a mocha note. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Combining Cabernet with Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, in that order percentage-wise, this is a well-made wine. Oaky and dusty with refined tannins, its fruit brightly centers around raspberry and red currant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine opens with aromas of black plum, grilled bell peppers, cedar and spice. The dense palate offers black cherry, espresso, chocolate and black pepper alongside firm but fleeting tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and rather simple, it conveys raspberry jam, cola, sweetened herb tea and smoky oak flavors. It's an easy Pinot to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied white conveys delicate fragrances of chamomile, Spanish broom and stone fruit. The round palate offers creamy white peach, apricot and nectarine alongside fresh acidity. A note of candied ginger signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, berry, blue flower and rose lead the nose. Still closed, the firm palate eventually reveals dry cherry, licorice and baking spice. A backbone of firm, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provides support. It closes on a menthol note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, woodland berry, pressed rose, tobacco leaf, savory herb and menthol aromas mingle in the glass. The palate delivers raw red cherry, anise, white pepper and a note of grilled sage alongside tightly knit tannins and brisk acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spearmint, plum, oak, and menthol aromas take shape in the glass. The dense palate shows ripe plum, espresso, vanilla and licorice alongside bracing tannins. Give this time to unwind. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft, rounded, a wine that is both fresh and open. Red berry fruits are suffused with acidity, giving a light touch. This is a wine for drinking in 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Hard to believe the price on this. Yes, it's a perfectly good aged Ribera, but special it isn't. Bricky and roasted on the nose, with spiced cherry and plum aromas. The palate is healthy and comfortable, with cola, cherry and licorice flavors. Vanilla and length define the finish. Too regular to recommend at $325.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ultraripe, almost to the point of being syrupy and soupy. The nose is all sweet licorice, baked fruit and raisin. In the mouth, there's some tannic bite but mostly it's a rich, bruising, unctuous wine with smoky, rich berry flavors and a sweet, toasty finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Bordeaux blend, based on equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is softly opulent and ripe, in the way of many Paso Robles red wines. It floods the mouth with blackberries and currants, with spicy complexities from oak, and is fairly tannic, although not so much that a good steak won't cut through it. Best Now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Uriah is Spring Valley's Right Bank-style blend, with Merlot and Cabernet Franc sharing the lead. It's lively and fine-tuned, with a lovely mix of red fruits, spices, and fresh acidity. It spent 21 months in 65% new French oak, to good effect.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There are only a few drops of Syrah in this Cab, but you can taste them in the violets, cherries and pepper that complicate the cassis flavors. It's a good wine, although a little heavy and soft.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky wood flavors dominate this dense, wood-aged wine. It also has juicy red berry flavors and will be generous and very fine when mature. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alluring aromas of black-skinned berry, leather and tobacco lead the nose on this robust red. The concentrated, richly textured palate shows red cherry, prune and vanilla with a hint of orange zest. Velvety tannins provide support. Enjoy through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is 100% Cabernet, a combination of the winery's Palisades vineyard, in Calistoga, and Graveyard Hill, in Carneros. Strangely, it's not as good as either of those single-vineyard bottlings. It's too ripe, with stewed berry and raisin flavors that are almost Port-like.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a distant note of underbrush or bramble that gives this Brunello a focused, almost etched impression in the mouth. Cola, cherry liqueur, black licorice, ginger and cedar give the wine an austere personality that is matched by the dusty, elegant nature of the tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here is a broad and bold expression of Brunello with a dark appearance, ripe fruit flavors, cured meat, leather and lingering intensity. There's a genuine but one-dimensional feel in the mouth with more heavy tones of tobacco and spice to follow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth, rich and tannic, and lovely for drinking now. You'll find blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and toasty oak flavors, leading to a dry finish. Give it a little time in a decanter before pouring.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The name of the estate translates as \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cItalian wines to dream about,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and there is good reason to dream about this latest Brunello. The wine offers solid color and concentration accented by dark leather, spice, prune and blackberry. You can feel the extracted fruit in the mouth that finds balance against the wine's natural acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Il Puro (named for their organically-grown grapes) shows bright and polished notes of cherry and blackberry followed by wet earth, leather and tobacco. The mouthfeel is smooth, rich and dusty-dry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brunello Mastrojanni is always a highlight among the various wines from Montalcino. Bright and elegant, it shows aromas of cherry, cola, ginger, dried spice, leather and spice. The mouthfeel is lean and tight with crisp acidity and firm, polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A raw note of spice and tobacco gives this Brunello a brawny, masculine personality. Cherry cola, licorice, savory spice, smoked bacon and black currant hint at the many years of cellar aging that have shaped the evolution. Those flavors also add to the overall finesse and silkiness of the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very characteristic of the 2008 vintage, this young Brunello opens with soft and round aromas of cherry and blackberry backed by delicate tones of spice and tobacco. Once the wine hits the palate, you will feel that bright acidity that is so typical of Sangiovese Grosso.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright cherry cola and black currant gives this Brunello a plump and fruity personality that is difficult to find in the wines of 2008. Those fruit notes are raw, bold and are followed by a soft touch of milk chocolate or vanilla. The wine shows a creamy, velvety texture with a point of acidity and alcoholic heat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Petit Verdot-Cabernet Sauvignon blend clearly wants some time in the cellar. Although it's extraordinarily rich with blackberries, black currants and violets, the tannin-acid structure is such that aging for at least ten years shouldn't be a problem.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of characteristic Cabernet flavor in this wine. Blackberrry jam and cassis liqueur flavors flood the mouth, heady and flashy and long in the finish. The tannins are thick, yet so soft, you can enjoy this wine now, although it will develop over the next ten years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tall Tales is a new designation for the winery's reserve Syrah. It's unfined, unfiltered and unabashed\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a potent, powerful wine which teeters on the edge of bitterness. But within its compact and textural body are lively flavors of boysenberry and coffee grounds, tobacco and vanilla, cola and rock. It pushes deep into the palate and extends into a complex and long-lasting finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another great success from Merryvale. Somehow they manage to make red wines that are ripe, oaky and opulent, yet maintain balance so that you can drink it over the course of a meal without the flavors palling. Dry and tannicly sophisticated, it shows complex waves of blackberries, cassis, cherries and sweet, smoky cedar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of depth and complexity in this single-vineyard Cabernet. It's dramatic for the layers of fruit, veering toward red berries, cherries and cocoa, and for the intense tannin structure. Feels vital and important and, above all, ageable. Give it a good six years in the cellar.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A dark bruiser with heavy mocha, chocolate, tobacco, cola and crusty leather aromas in addition to massive fruit scents. It's huge in the mouth, with broad, grabby tannins, pumped-up acids and wide berry, vanilla and coconut flavors. Dark like coffee on the finish, with titanic tannins and foundation. Best from 2013 through 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: One of the most exciting names in Barolo, with fruit from one of the most celebrated vineyard crus, this vintage of Cannubi Boschis is a real treasure. Cellar the wine 10 years or more to achieve balance between its firm tannins and bright acidity. The wine already shows incredibly complex aromas of wild berry fruit, truffle and cola and those tones will surely become more elegant with time.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Brawny but lovely, with monster black fruit, balsam wood, tobacco and cola nut aromas. The palate is ultra rich and modern in style, with deep, brandied flavors of cola, black cherry and spice. Driven, modern and properly tannic, with a fair amount of mocha and creaminess on the finish. Drink from late 2010 thru 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Founded in 1930 by Ferruccio Grimaldi, this family-run estate is now showing some very exciting results. The La Coste Barolo is a tight and focused wine that promises to age beautifully over many more years. The tannins and acidity are perfectly integrated and the nose boasts bright and intense layers of forest fruit, exotic spice, mesquite and black licorice.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The Le Vigne cru from Luciano Sandrone delivers focused aromas of wild cherries, white almond, cola and light shadings of sweet spice. The texture is drying and firm and the wine excels in the mouth thanks to the tight and supple feel of its tannins. Pair this delicious wine with lamb, pork or beef.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Huge wine with sweetness and smooth qualities from head to toe. Aromas of mint leaf, pastry and sweet black fruits are magnetic, while the lush, layered palate is complete and packed with berry fruit, toast, fudge and tobacco flavors. Layered and deep on the finish, with cola, herbs and licorice notes. Beautiful wine. Drinkable now and good through 2013.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The vineyard is, of course, in Oakville, which makes you wonder why they put the generic Napa Valley on the label. The wine itself, which is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is very dry and tannic. Flamboyant, too, with deep black currant flavors bathed in 100% new French oak. Feels lavish and important, but young. Better left untouched for 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Poderi Luigi Einaudi consistently produces some of the world's best Barolo and its Cannubi cru expression is particularly elegant and refined in the 2005 vintage. The wine boasts power and density backed by delicate aromas of wild raspberry, spice and drying mineral notes. It imparts a firm but smooth feel in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a young, dry, acidic Pinot Noir that clearly wants some time in the cellar. It has a beautifully silky texture, and is made in a light, elegant style, with very complex flavors. Waves of sour red cherry candy and cola flavors wash over the palate, accented with orange zest, cinnamon, Asian spices, anise and sandalwood. Better after 2011 and should develop for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years after that.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Classic Duckhorn, which is to say, dry, tannic, elegantly structured and expensive. The winemaker succeeded, in this so-so year, in crafting a rich, nuanced wine of considerable interest. It may not be a longterm ager, but it's delicious now, with deep flavors of blackberries, red currants, violets, cocoa and smoky oak, balanced with the prettiest acidity. Grows better in the glass as it breathes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thickly concentrated, this wine offers a wealth of cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9ee richness and complexity, dotted in golden honey and a twist of lime. Supple and medium in build, it integrates the oak and ripeness at its core, finishing with a brightness of acidity that refreshes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dried strawberry and prune juice meet with black spice, dust and roasted meats on the nose of this six-year-old bottling. The palate shows decent depth, from mocha and coffee to tobacco, cedar and caramel, all decorating the core flavors of black-cherry pie and bacon fat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's menthol, new leather, blue flower and sage aromas lead the nose, along with a whiff of toast. It's taut and savory on the palate, offering crunchy red berry, star anise, ground clove and tobacco notes framed by youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured blend of Nero d'Avola, Petit Verdot, Syrah and a small percentage of other grape varieties offers cassis, mocha and underbrush aromas. The dense palate doles out prune, carob, licorice and pipe tobacco notes alongside velvety tannins. Enjoy through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lean and dry on the palate, this medium-bodied wine has a subtle concentration of red-fruit flavors and fine layers of mineral and spice that unfold on the palate. Grown on a pioneering property along the Sonoma Cost, it will be best after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This soft, high alcohol blend of Grenache, Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre and Syrah is marked by extremely ripe flavors of blackberry jam and milk chocolate. It's technically dry but finishes with a touch of brown sugar. Drink now for voluptuous richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This rich Cabernet drinks beautifully now for its ripe, forward blackberry, cassis liqueur and oak flavors. It's smooth and dry, with classic Napa balance. Good as it is, it should develop in the bottle over the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A robust blend of 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, mocha, menthol and oak-driven spice. The hearty palate initially opens with black fruit, chocolate, licorice and dried herb flavors but the heat of evident alcohol dominates the finish and the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dense and concentrated, this blend of 66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc and 8% Petit Verdot initially has a subdued nose that eventually reveals prune, alcohol, tobacco and leather aromas. The syrupy palate doles out blackberry extract, fig, sweet spice and soaring alcohol alongside velvety tannins. While some may like the sheer power, the dominant alcohol stunts any complexity, giving it a monolithic quality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a new bottling from Justin, and it's one of its best wines in years. Blended mostly from Syrah, with a splash of Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre and Grenache, it's rich, ripe and velvety smooth. The wine shows a warm-climate touch of overripeness in the chocolate-covered raisin flavor, which gives it a Port-like warmth. Otherwise, the flavors veer toward blackberry and cassis liqueur.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is right up there with previous vintages of Krutz's Malbec, which have been among the best in California. It's certainly not a shy wine, showing Malbec's power to dazzle with its sheer volume. Offering endless waves of blackberry and black pepper, with thick tannins and vibrant acidity, this is the perfect wine to drink now with charbroiled beef.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows the power and purity of the winery's coastal Pastorale and Quarter Moon vineyards, in this cool vintage that allowed for long hang time. Although some coastal Pinots were plagued by rot, this one was not, resulting in a wine with delicious raspberry and cherry notes, accented by new French oak. It's very fine, complex and enjoyable now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the best Tempranillo-based wines in California history. The other varieties blended in are Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc. Bone dry and tannic, though a little warm in alcohol, it shows its mountain origins\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094from the southeast corner of the Vacas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094with its immaculate core of blackberry and cassis. Compellingly delicious now and over the next 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This exudes classic Chardonnay richness. Pure and heady, it explodes with tropical fruit and orange essences, with buttered toast and vanilla flavors from oak barrels and lees contact. Zesty Russian River acidity kicks in to provide perfect balance. The creaminess is delicious, suggesting shellfish in a buttery sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with inky, dark concentration and offers many of the beautiful aromas associated with the Cabernet family of grapes: Dark berry, prune, dried spice and chocolate. It delivers impressive intensity and persistency, with well-formed tannins and mocha softness on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sangiovese, Syrah and Merlot are blended to form a rich and supple red, with black cherry, chocolate, cinnamon and blackberry nuances. The mouthfeel is characterized by richness, softness and a touch of bright crispness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with elegant and finely tuned aromas of wild berry, dried ginger, smoked bacon and dried herb. It is still toasty and young at this point and will benefit from another 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years of cellar aging. The tannins are smooth and polished.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A hint of flinty reduction still plays on the nose, barely letting any of the pure fruit notes escape but both ripe and crisp pear appear. The palate still shows some yeasty funk but convinces with purity, sheer power and concentration. This feels urgent and direct, strong and stony, boisterous with sheer force and drive. This needs time to settle but will be a very convincing, even forceful and energetic Pinot Gris with some bottle age. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00942035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Yeasty funk still dominates the nose and only lets a touch of lemon zest through. The palate continues with the zesty background against which flashes of riper fruit appear: juicy pear and luscious tangerine. The fruit expression is ripe but utterly fresh. The taut dry palate is anchored in something cool and fresh, something that expands as texture and fills not only the palate but also the mind. This is fresh and luminous, elegant and fine boned. Drink now through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Something floral and stony appears on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and something uncompromising and hard. The palate then packs a real punch: the wine hits you like a bullet of concentrated freshness and citric verve. This is bundled and effective, delivering a hit of ripened freshness with its lemon-zest dominated, dry tanginess. The finish has something juicy and luscious and is absolutely dry and clean. Totally lip-smacking. Drink now through 2027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From another of the producer's coastal estate sites, this wine is juicy, spicy and leathery\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a celebration of fresh wild strawberries and buzzy acidity. Earth, rose and white pepper flavors add welcome complexity within a tightly woven frame of structure and length.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lifted ethereal notes of bitter almond and peach kernel alongside hints of chamomile announce evolution and development. Underneath these aromatic forces on the nose, the palate reveals ripe peach and pear on a very concentrated, absolutely streamlined and bone-dry body. Pleasantly bitter pith notes give a grown-up edge to this mature marvel. Wonderfully layered flavors make you linger and show what time can do to a classy Pinot Gris.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A touch of funkiness hovers over fresh pear notes. The palate then offers fresh-faced, tart and ripe pear notes, etched with citrus freshness for extra precision and purity. This is so inviting and disarming, it is a joy to savor. Despite the generously ripe fruit, a coolness runs through this, anchoring the flavors in freshness and drive. Simply delicious and so balanced, so you can enjoy it now, though it will cellar well through 2027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Preserved mandarins are evoked on the nose. The palate continues this rich and luscious but zesty citrus game: tangerine, clementine and orange weave their sweet-tart aromatic course across the palate and into your heart. This has lovely richness but not an ounce of fat. Streamlined Riesling freshness bathes rich late harvest sweetness in bright refreshing light. The zesty finish makes you crave more. Drink now through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is made from parcels on steep slopes and produced as the family's flagship wine. At nearly three years old, it has already mellowed into a richly endowed wine, ripe with green fruits, spice and concentrated acidity. There is so much complexity to this finely structured wine that will allow it to age further. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A lifted ethereal note of dried hay flowers hits you first. This is followed by generously ripe but very purely drawn fruit: Conference pear, star fruit and white currant. There is concentration on the palate, coupled with a pervasive citric freshness that almost lends this an exotic aspect. You simply want to savor and take another sip. An edge of pleasant bitterness corrals the fruit admirably. The finish is dry, lasting and intriguing.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From the fantastic mountain site and blended with 3% Malbec, this wine has a cherry-vanilla nose that leads to a meaty, substantial palate of black pepper, leather and clove flavors. Full-bodied, robust and intense, it's well worth cellaring, to be enjoyed between 2024 and 2034.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Both dried and baked apple appear enticingly on the nose. A further sniff reveals the appetizing tartness of Cox Orange Pippin apples. The palate is concentrated and gathered around a rich core of fruit: ripe citrus, zesty lemon rind, baked apples. This is dry, yet with every sip you want to dive deeper into that heart of fruit. It is the lemon that forms the fresh but absolutely dry finish. The flavors clearly are evolving: join the journey now or over the coming years. Drink now through 2030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Densely packed black fruit seasoned with cola and clove defines this robust, full-bodied, mountain wine blended with 8% Malbec. Spicy acidity keeps it fresh and lively in the glass, adding complexity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Cassis liqueur marks this structured Cab divine in firm, lengthy tannins and a chewy grip of black licorice. Given similar treatment to the winery's other highest echelon Cabs, it has 22 months in new French oak that will help it age through 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense aromas of dried rose, leather, truffle and crushed berry lead the nose. The ripe, forward palate offers crushed black cherry, wild raspberry, cinnamon white pepper and sage alongside chewy tannins. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This late release, aging for five years, has produced a majestic wine. Its breadth of flavor, with ripe fruits as well as intense structure, are gently transitioning from the first flush of youth to a more mature character. Intensely textured, tight, ready to spring, it shows the beauty of maturing Riesling. Drink now, although it will age many more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red and black berries, tilled earth, leather and balsamic notes characterize this structured, single-vineyard bottling. The savory palate delivers creamy cherry-berry layered with mint, white pepper, licorice and balsamic herbs supported by firm tannins. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, tobacco, dark cherry, licorice and grilled herb are just some of the aromas offered by this structured wine. The palate delivers mature black cherry, black pepper, sage and licorice alongside tongue-coating tannins that need time to soften. It hails from a top vineyard site and is an impressive effort from this hot, dry vintage. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 100% Syrah and aged in half new French oak, this brawny Syrah hails from a vineyard known for its mix of power and finesse. Sanguine and smoky, the fruit leans toward blueberry and the texture to leather, a streak of graphite in the background. Tannins are firm and sizable, with a balanced finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big, rich, flashy Cab. It's very ripe, brimming with jammy blackberry, currant, chocolate-covered raisin and spicy olive flavors. Drinks soft and opulent in instant appeal, but doesn't seem like a longterm ager. Best now through 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A deliciously soft, smoky wine, the tannins a hint behind the rounded fresh berry and red-plum fruits. There is a great juicy character to go with the fresh acidity and the final, drier structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, bold and leathery red, its full-bodied tannic profile accented by blackberry and coffee notes. Grippy in texture, it shows dense fruit ripeness and classic underpinnings of earthy spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine has a glorious floral nose highlighted in honey and wildflowers, revealing richer gingerbread and toasted oak undertones as it opens. Its creamy texture provides a sense of unctuousness, complemented by tart green apple and lemon on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This rich and generous wine has weight, concentrated yellow fruit and citrus flavors. Full bodied, its rounded texture is cut by a mineral element that brings the crisp acidity of the vintage. Developing well, it will be best from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blends 64% Syrah with 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot to good effect, offering tomato leaf, leather, dried herb and lavender aromas. Savory, meaty and medium bodied on the palate, it pairs well with heavier fare.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pipe tobacco, fruit cake and baking spice aromas come together on this vibrant red while the structured palate offers red cherry, cranberry, coffee bean and star anise. A zesty note of orange peel closes the firm finish while tightly wound fine-grained tannins provide the backbone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of baked plum, new leather and pipe tobacco emerge in the glass. The big muscular palate offers fleshy black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, licorice and vanilla alongside the heat of evident alcohol. Firm velvety tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A structured wine from the Chadronnier family, it is full of tannins and also full of sweeping black-fruit flavors. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated. Don't drink until at least 2020 to get the full generosity of the wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dense, baked, raisiny nose is ultra ripe but also a bit flabby and damp-smelling. A big, grabby mouth-filler, this offers baked, oaky flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate, finishing with lingering chocolate and prune. Drink this chunky, superripe Priorat sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina, this opens with aromas of aromatic herb, wild berry, menthol and a floral note. The firm, vibrant palate offers tar, sour cherry, licorice and white pepper alongside youthfully austere, fine-grained tannins. This needs time to soften up and fully develop. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This displays primary aromas of black fruit along with whiffs of roasted herbs and espresso. The palate offers black plum, prune and Morello cherry accented by black pepper, coffee, toast and vanilla. Youthfully aggressive and tightly packed, this needs time to fully develop. Drink after 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a classic Nebbiolo fragrance of Morello cherry, dried rose petal, mint and thyme. The ripe palate offers up crushed black cherry, prune, black pepper, cake spices and licorice alongside brooding tannins and uplifting acidity. It's already well balanced but will be even better in another few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a wonderful, dense wine, very concentrated, very intensely flavored. At this stage of its development, it is the opulence which is most evident, but there are already hints that it will show pure fruit alongside sweet tannins, and will develop complexity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sometimes it seems as if La Mission is as good as Haut-Brion - that was certainly the case in 2001. But in 2000, La Mission fitted more comfortably into its usual good neighbor slot. That is not to suggest it is not a great wine - the score indicates that. At the moment, it is closed, solid and chunky, but all the right hints are there, and it will develop slowly and in a sustained way over many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At first taste, this wine seems more new world than Bordeaux. But then the subtle, perfumed aromas and structured fruit show through, along with the clean acidity and black tannic fruits. Give this wine at least 12 years before opening.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: At this stage, this is very closed, very tight, giving little. But it is possible to discern that this is going to be a beautiful wine. There are flavors of sweet raisins and the fruit has a new world richness, but the structure of dry tannins is always present. It looks as though it has a good, long life.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The renaissance of Kirwan, with the consultancy of Michel Rolland, continues with this ripe, forward, concentrated wine. The tannins are sweet and soft, with a solid, chunky structure that promises a long life. The finish displays balanced new wood flavors and a smooth polish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: It is the power that is so evident in this wine - a full, up-front expression of Merlot at its most powerful. It is somewhat closed up at this stage, but it is going to continue its development as an enormous wine which still manages to keep its power under firm control.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Really smooth textured. Quite elegant as well, with sleek, complex layers of black currant, blackberry, plum, black cherry, herb, chocolate, coffee, spice, toast and a beguiling hint of tar. The wine is incredibly complex and inviting, framed beautifully in velvety tannins. Long and lush on the finish, it's blended from grapes grown on Mt. Veeder, Atlas Peak and the Napa Valley floor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Moueix-owned premier grand cru class\\u00c3\\u00a9 property quietly goes about producing great wines. The 2000 is a complete success, with its aromas of red berry fruits and sweet wood, its flavors cedar and truffles alongside the fine, elegant tannins. It will age slowly and reveal layers of complexity over the years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a solid, huge wine, with rich but very dry tannins. With its dense, almost black color, and its sense of brooding power, it promises long aging. It will never be in the opulent Bordeaux camp, despite its prominent new wood flavors, but will probably outlive all but a handful top wines.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the flagship wine from the mini-empire (now comprising five properties) that is controlled by Comte Stephan von Niepperg. He has made a modern, wood dominated wine, with rich, concentrated black fruits. It is powerful, perhaps too powerful, lacking a sense of the usual grace of this estate, although the ripeness of the wine does compensate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In 2000, this was still the property of Lily Lacoste, who also owned P\\u00c3\\u00a9trus. Latour \\u00c3\\u00a0 Pomerol was sold  in 2001 to a Catholic charity. The management, then and now, is with the Moueix family who make the most of the fabulous vineyard. The 2000 is a hugely opulent, velvet textured wine, but it retains hints of the elegance that is the hallmark of this property.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Under the regime of G\\u00c3\\u00a9rard Perse, Pavie seems to have become more opulent, more extracted, and, dare I say it, more simplistic. The richness of the 2000 vintage lends itself to this technique. While it is a wonderful, immediately appealing wine, with its intense dark fruits, it seem to lack the complexity of other wines of similar status.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine starts of with intriguing bacon and earth tones that are followed up by rich, ripe raspberry, black cherry, spice, licorice, herb and toast flavors. It's beautifully balanced, with supple tannins and a flashy, robust character that remains enticing and long at the end. Look for more of this varietal from Darioush as its Shiraz vineyards mature.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet tastes way too oaky. Vanilla cream and caramel dominate the blackberries and black currants, giving it a woody sweetness. The question is, will it age out? The classic answer is that a wine that tastes unbalanced when young most likely always will.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to the blackberries and cherries. The thinness of fruit accentuates the alcohol which, although only 14.6%, comes through as hot. The grapes came from the cool Coombsville area, and the wine is 100% Cabernet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Amarone Ambrosan opens with lovely tones of plush fruit and savory spice followed by plum cake, cinnamon and sweet bread. This is a deeply layered wine with soft tannins and a blast of bright red cherry on the close. Very nice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine was grown on the warmer slopes of Sonoma Mountain, a less known but respected part of Sonoma County. It's dry and firm in tannins, with rich flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and oak. Flashy and delicious now, it should gain in the bottle over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the standout Amarones from the lovely 2007 vintage, Case Vecie is opulent, rich and impressive in terms of intensity and complexity. It opens with dark, inky concentration and releases a long line of black cherry, spice and soft tobacco flavors. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Amarone Il Bosco delivers a soft succession of sweet cherry, spice, plum cake and licorice-like aromas. The wine's thickness density and natural concentration is packed tight with bright cherry and blackberry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Corte Rugolin hits a home run thanks to the amazing intensity and beauty of this darkly concentrated Amarone. It opens with a linear, focused bouquet that is accented by aromas of blackberry, spice, leather and tobacco. Dark fruit flavors shimmer between the luscious, velvety folds of the rich mouthfeel.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aged in traditional oak casks for six long years, Bertani's beautiful 2004 Amarone delivers the best of Valpolicella. It shows beautiful complexity and elegance that is articulated by tobacco, brown sugar, cassis and sweet tobacco flavors. There's substance and length on the close with a delicately smoky aftertaste.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You can't help but fall in love with Brigaldara's delicious Amarone, especially if you love bold, dense wines. The aromas roll out slowly and with care, giving space to elements of cola, red cherry, blackberry, drying mineral and dark teriyaki sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With 75% Corvina Veronese, 15% Rondinella and 10% Sangiovese, this Amarone stands out thanks to its dramatically different aromatic profile. The Sangiovese component must be responsible for the wild strawberry, cherry candy, pressed blue flowers and white licorice. It's fresh too, with a sweet, but crisp close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This hefty Amarone could use a few more years of cellar aging, but already it shows a dark, saturated color and inky density with smoked barbecue, prune, cola, leather and black pepper notes. The tannins are firm and show a touch of bitterness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a delightful note of herbs and green olives to this Bordeaux-style Cabernet, although it also shows plenty of red cherries and black raspberries. With smooth, refined tannins, it's just superb for drinking now, although it should age well in a cool cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense and rich, this darkly concentrated Amarone is redolent of mature fruit, strawberry jam, tobacco leaf, cedar wood, cigar box and brown sugar. It feels syrupy and dense on the palate with soft tannins and a smooth finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spring Valley wines have never been shy and retiring, but here the alcohol \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 15.2% \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0093 seems to quickly mute the textural subtleties. Though it suggests a panoply of red and black fruits in the nose, the palate is a wash of coffee, toast, tannin and alcohol. The flavors get muddy and the alcohol strips the wine of its terroir.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot, this opens with aromas of prune, scorched earth, toast and a hint of black currant. On the structured palate, notes of grilled bell pepper, espresso and dried herb accent a core of dried black cherry alongside fine-grained tannins that give it a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle aromas of chocolate, espresso and ripe bluish-black fruit lead the nose of this robust blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 35% Syrah and 25% Sangiovese. The concentrated palate delivers ripe plum, dried black cherries, clove and black pepper alongside bracing tannins. You'll also notice the heat of alcohol on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This robust wine opens with aromas of dried rose, tar, leather, fig and allspice. The full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherries, licorice, underbrush and grilled sage alongside firm, velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, chocolate, nutmeg and spiced plum lead the nose of this robust wine. The ripe palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, tobacco and baking spice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A dense, full-bodied red, this opens with aromas of blackberry jam, vanilla, oak and a whiff of herbs. The robust palate delivers fleshy black cherry, cracked black pepper, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. You'll also the notice the heat of evident alcohol, especially on the close, which throws it somewhat off-balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, this offers aromas of cedar, leafy underbrush, scorched earth, ripe dark fruit and ground black pepper. The palate delivers dried black currants, licorice, mint and tobacco alongside velvety tannins. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Now definitely mature, even drying up, this wine needs to be drunk now. It has developed a dry, tannic character, woody and stalky, although its balance is still there and the aftertaste has some juiciness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine opens with aromas of baked plum, leather, underbrush, grilled herb and a toasted note. The ripe, chewy palate offers raspberry jam, fleshy black cherry, licorice and a hint of vanilla alongside solid tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, charred earth, truffle, star anise and a hint of menthol come together in the glass. The ripe palate shows dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and mocha alongside solid, assertive tannins. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grilled herb, forest floor, scorched earth, cured meat and menthol aromas lead the way. The ripe palate offers juicy wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon, pipe tobacco and a confectionary note alongside firm, enveloping tannins. It's already accessible and will make fine near- to mid-term drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Engaging scents suggesting rose, iris, perfumed berry and Mediterranean herb meld together in the glass. The soft, bright palate offers red cherry, raspberry, a hint of tobacco and a coffee note alongside supple tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coffee, toast, nut, forest floor and fleshy plum aromas waft out of the glass. The big, round palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and chopped herb alongside ripe, loosely knit tannins. It's straightforward for a Brunello but it has a juicy, immediate appeal. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a Cab that needs food to round it off and polish its rough edges. Very dry and a bit angular in tannins, with a peppery bite and generous flavors of cherries and blackberries.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From its own estate, this Louis Latour wine is a ripe, strawberry- and juicy plum-flavored wine, sustained by a well- judged dry layer of tannins. It is sweet, the acidity showing through in the red fruits.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here's a standout Sangiovese-based super Tuscan with a very unique peppermint-like characteristic that helps to increase the wine's intensity and delicious overall effect. Beyond that layer of fresh mint are softer aromas of earth, white mineral, talc powder, pencil lead, cherry and spice. The wine has a strong mineral component.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The first vintage of this experimental, 7,000 vines per acre wine. An intense, dense wine, all the herbaceous, mineral character of Sauvignon Blanc is magnified with orange zest, touches of pear skin and a steely acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured red opens with aromas of tilled earth, mature plum, toasted oak, leather and a whiff of cellar floor. The vibrant palate delivers crushed black cherry, plum cake, cinnamon and dried sage, with assertive tannins and bright acidity. It closes on a licorice note. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of spiced plum, oak, vanilla and leather. The smooth, concentrated palate offers ripe black cherry, juicy raspberry, mocha, clove, tobacco, black pepper and licorice alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Contino gives its single-vineyard Graciano all that it can, and still the wine, despite its deep purple color, is tight as a drum. There's juniper and blueberry on the nose, and then tangy blackberry flavors with an herbal slant. As varietal Graciano goes, this is nicely done. But it's up to you to decide if varietal Graciano is worth $147 a pop.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ultra-rich, with chocolate-infused dark berry flavors, splashed with cassis and accented with smoky new oak. Although the wine, which is 100% Cabernet, is totally dry, it's soft, which accentuates the alcohol, making it taste a bit hot and unbalanced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Loads of clove, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg spice show up the strawberry, blueberry and red cherry aromas of this lavish bottling, which also offers scents of crushed rock and turned earth. Similar elements entertain the palate, culminating with a minty pine needle note, proving to be a very dynamic sip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The closed nose leads onto a compact palate that mixed red cherry notes with sandalwood oak spice. This is elegant and evolves beautifully in the glass. It will sing with earthy mushroom dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blue flower, espresso, menthol and dried sage aromas lead the nose. The full-bodied tannic palate offers dried black cherry and the warmth of alcohol alongside oak-driven sensations of coconut, roasted coffee bean and a hint of licorice. Solid grainy tannins provide the framework and give it a somewhat astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle aromas of red berry, new leather, forest floor and a whiff of tobacco lead the nose. On the straightforward, rather lean palate, firm polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework for red cherry, cranberry and a hint of clove. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find earthy aromas of used leather, game and a slight whiff of barnyard on this soulful red. The funky aromas follow over to the palate along with fleshy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon and a note of salted game. The rounded tannins are rather forward for such a young Barolo. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Overoaked, with sweet, caramelized wood and vanilla flavors dominating an otherwise soft, ripe wine. The blackberries and cherries have a sugary finish, making the wine tiresome.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of scorched earth, cooked black-skinned fruit and a funky whiff of barnyard. The aromas carry over to the palate along with notes of prune, overripe black fruit and green sensations that recall powdered sage. It's on the rustic side, while raspy tannins lend it an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An earthy funk and puckeringly dry tannins mark this wine, which remains dry on the palate from start to finish, characterized along the way in leather and black pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe black plum, cooking spice and scorched earth lead the nose. The robust, bulky palate offers prune, dried cherry, vanilla and a hint of white pepper set against bracing tannins while the heat of scorching alcohol throws it off balance. Drink soon to catch the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, stewed prune and tobacco aromas follow over to the rather lean, evolved palate along with dried cherry, espresso and a hint of clove. Drink this over the next few years to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is named for the mother of one of the owners, an artist and teacher who provided the inspired artwork found on the label. It blends mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Merlot and is soft in red currant with fully developed acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Blueberry, plum cake, mocha, vanilla and sweet pipe tobacco aromas jump from the glass of this mature, structured wine. On the palate, notes of cinnamon and anisette back up primary flavors of dried black cherry and blackberry. Thanks to its smooth tannins, this would be nice to sip after dinner in front of the fire.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ripe and dense from a warm vintage, this wine shows aromas of cedar, tobacco, black plum and blackberry on the nose. The baked fruit core is accented by cardamon and warm spice, then turns oaky and darker in character. Drink through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gap's Crown remains a magical site for Pinot producers and Fulcrum does justice to it, providing a subtle entry of soft oak on the nose before letting it open further into dark, brambly berry and earth. The backbone is strong and structured, and the finish is long and soft, with an ideal seasoning of exotic Mediterranean spice and herb that linger fully and invite one in for more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: At this stage, this is a wood-dominated wine. Its potential is considerable because beneath this wood and toast awaits a wonderful range of ripe apples, apricots and mango that promise to develop into a full, generous wine. Keep until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense and delicious, this unfolds with aromas of black fruit, plum cake and baking spices. The rich palate offers black plum, blackberry and black cherry alongside layers of chocolate, clove, vanilla and black licorice. Despite its weight, it's balanced, with assertive but round tannins. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense, dark-fruit aromas of blueberry and cassis are earthy and almost overripe. A saturated, bold palate delivers blackberry, chocolate, fig, herb and rooty flavors in front of a chunky finish. Consistent with the Vall Llach house style, this is ripe and modern. Drink now through 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The power and structure of a Corton-Charlemagne are very evident in this firm and closed wine. At this young stage, it is all about the concentrated texture and weight. The acidity and the rich fruits will come later. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The acidity is pretty fierce, but the wine is dry, and offers easy flavors of cherries, raspberries, red currants and sandalwood. The blend is Merlot and Cabernet Franc.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made from a majority of Cabernet Franc, complemented with a small handful of Merlot, the wine is aged in new French oak half barrels. Tannic and savory in cassis and cranberry, the wine also shows a trace of black tea and tomato leaf. The wine's oak remains extremely pronounced, which suggests some time in cellar, through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a hilltop location near the ocean-influenced town of Freestone, this wine is silky in plum and dark cherry, a hint of mushroomed earth doing its best to come out. Robust on the palate, juicy berry fruit satisfies, finishing thick and rich.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas of charred earth, game and a funky whiff of barnyard. The evolved palate offers dried black cherries, prune, coffee, clove, oak and licorice alongside fleeting but astringent tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Gorgeous aromas of toasty oak, wood smoke, minerals and layered black fruits feed into a concentrated, thick palate that demands a knife and fork for dissection. Flavors of toast, vanilla bean, woodspice, bacon, mint and blackberry are lush. Give this beauty another couple of years, then drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sanguine and brooding in dense layers of juicy black fruit, leather and tobacco, this is classic Napa Valley Cabernet with an elegance at its core, that's also seamless, complex and age-worthy. From relatively cooler sites in Oak Knoll and Mount Veeder, and a cooler year too, this vintage sings for this producer, showing balance and power in equal measure.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With its strongly mineral-textured base, this is a complex, impressive wine. It has fruit weight with lychees, mangos and spiced pears along with acidity that gives the wine just the lift it needs. Power and style go hand-in-hand in this wine. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full-bodied and exuberant in lush tannins, this black Shiraz is concentrated and rich in hearty leather, espresso and black tea yet buoyed by lively acidity and beautiful streaks of black and white pepper.

It's radiant, with wonderful intensity and elegance, delivering ripe red cherry, raspberry compote, mineral, licorice, baking spice and a hint of mint alongside a backbone of firm, fine-grained tannins and edgy acidity.

Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932032.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a sweet Gewurztraminer, almost a dessert style. The name comes from a title whose origins date back to the Dark Ages in Europe. The wine is rich, now fully matured, a wonderful medley of ripe fruits, honey and spice. Layers of flavors are interspersed with acidity that lifts the wine. It's opulent, delicious and ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard-designated wine reflects its sense of place remarkably well, offering tight dark cherry and blueberry around a strong character of wild earth, tea and herb. High in acidity and minerality, and yet powerfully understated, it's gorgeously drinkable now but will gain further complexity through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Layered fragrances suggest perfumed berry, orange zest, crushed wild flower, baking spice and tobacco.

It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gentle notions of pear emanate from the glass. The palate is equally gentle: ripe pear fruit, balanced by lovely lemon freshness. There is an arresting interplay of residual sweetness and zesty acidity at the core.

The wine is tannic, peppery and rich in currant and chocolate flavors, with high alcohol. Seems a pace or two behind more recent vintages.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One for the cellar. It's vibrantly rich and forward in blackberries, black cherries, plums, dark chocolate and sweet smoky new oak, yet very tannic. Creates an astringency that lasts through the spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2012, and will last for years after.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Beautiful from start to finish, but tannic, and not drinkable now, in the classic sense.

It's round from start to finish, a luscious Chardonnay. Just some crispness at the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As usual with a Hirsch Pinot, the wine is young and thick and jammy, even a little heavy, and needs time to develop. The wild raspberry, sour cherry, cola and Asian spices have a touch of smoky new oak, while the tannins and acids are noticeable, providing a dry architecture for the ripe fruit. Should develop over the next decade, as everything comes together into balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Corley builds its reserve Cab for the long haul. The wine is too tannic to enjoy now, numbing the palate with dry astringency. But there's great depth here, to judge by the wealth of black currant flavor that's accented by rich new oak. Cellar this puppy until at least 2008, and it should hit its prime from 2010 and for many years after.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very firm, this is a structured, relatively austere wine, with lots of minerality and tightness.

Screwcap.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is so closed up at the moment, all mineral and steel, that it is hard to feel the ripeness of the tropical fruit. As this develops, it will flesh out the yellow fruits, balancing the acidity. The aftertaste is already thirst quenching.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness.

However, for the future, watch those tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Forward, rather jammy in blackberry, black raspberry, cherry, cola and cedar, with a dessert pastry richness suggesting macaroons and oatmeal raisin cookies. Incongruous as it sounds, there's also a complementary dusting of dried rosemary, lavender and thyme, like the garrigue scent of a southern Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne wine. Drinks delicious and smooth, although lacking a touch of the refinement of St. Eden.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A pure expression of Syrah from coastal Tuscany, this plush wine opens with cherry, tobacco and cigar-like aromas.

Drink from 2012 through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Elevates the Keller style of superripe, oaky Chardonnay into a more refined, balanced wine, equally rich but more perfect. It's still potent in buttered toast, vanilla, caramel, honey and pineapple jam, but crisp acidity and minerality help to give structure to the opulence.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Prunaio delivers aromas of prune, rum cake and cherry liqueur. The fruit is dark and savory, and there's an aged, almost gritty quality to the mouthfeel.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made with slightly overripe grapes, this has aromas of menthol, exotic spice and baked plum.

The aromas of red and black fruit, brown stems, green olive, coffee and spice are initially faint while the tart red-fruit flavors bring a sense of delicacy and restraint.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Exemplary Gran Reserva Rioja blending modernity with the best traditions of this famed region. Perfumed, lush and complex to start, then vibrant in the mouth, with excellent integration of flavors, acidity and tannins. Tastes of fine tobacco, mulled blackberry, chocolate and dry spices. Proper as the textbook calls for but individual as well. Best from 2014\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A similar blend to the Ovide; this is 62% Cabernet Sauvignon and 38% Syrah. The fruit is more forward here, with pretty blackberry and black cherry flavors, and a dark and forceful streak of iron and charcoal and licorice. A light lavender note adds interest.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A deep and compact wine with Syrah fruit styled with a Cabernet-like verticality, this layers ripe berry fruit with streaks of graphite, ash and rock. The flavors persist through a lingering, super clean finish with the balance and acidity to age. What are initially tightly wound subtleties of herb and spice may well expand into nuanced complexity over the next decade or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the best Cabernet-Syrah blends out there. The Cabernet dominates, with firm tannins and blackberry and currant flavors, but Syrah brings a meatiness, like teriaki beef. Terrifically interesting, this wine should develop over the next four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the most succulent and drinkable Napa Cabernets of the '08 vintage. With Merlot added to the blend, it's rich in blackberries, cherries, currants and cedar, with firm but pliant tannins that give a beautiful structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pure and penetrating, with full berry aromas and power throughout. Tight and generous in the mouth, with nice acidity and structured tannins. Tastes toasty and black, with loads of berry, chocolate and spice flavors. Impressive and big; drink now through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, toast, espresso, peppermint and a whiff of blue flower lead the nose. The firm palate offers dark cherry, cake spice, grilled herb and anise alongside tightly wound, assertive tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Now winemaker for Swanson, Robin Ackhurst excels here in this tiny production of his own wine, which exhibits exotic plum and juicy blackberry. A 100% varietal offering, it has a girth of structured tannin and toasty oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The pale ros\\u00c3\\u00a9 color doesn't detract from this concentrated, ripe wine that offers yellow fruits, orange zest and spicy flavors. Pure acidity gives intense freshness and an impressive depth of flavor. The wine will be better after more aging, so drink from late 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an internationally-styled Barolo, with oak-driven aromas of toasted wood and roasted coffee beans. The palate shows black fruit flavors layered with oak, vanilla and espresso, accompanied by astringent wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and ponderous for a Pinot Noir, almost like Grenache, it's so full-bodied and rich in cherries, mocha, anise and spices. Delicious in its way, but lacks Pinot finesse and subtlety. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle aromatics of earthy rose petal surround this silky, light wine, steeped in acidity and a damp-forested quality. Spicy throughout in cinnamon, cardamom and grated nutmeg, the wine picks up a girth of thickness on the finish, a knot of tannin that gives it a swath of complexity and cellaring possibilities, through 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Violet, iris, leather, tobacco, vanilla and savory herb aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The structured palate delivers juicy morello cherry, crushed black cherry, anisette, black pepper and tobacco. It's brightened by firm acidity while bracing tannins provide support. It finishes on a licorice note. Give this time to unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This powerful, dense wine has a good, long journey to travel. The 20% wood aging has given a surprising amount of toastiness to the black plum fruit and intense acidity. It needs to age, so drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A blend of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, this structured wine opens with aromas of dried blue flower, leather, game, graphite, mature black fruit and baking spice. On the palate, velvety tannins support ripe blueberry, spicy plum and licorice. Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A Cabernet with 12% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot blended in, all from Sonoma Valley's Rancho Salina Vineyard, this wine is medium in weight and viscous. A nice mix of cedar and herbs play against savory cranberry and tobacco. The balanced acidity gives it a lift.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Maritime bottling traditionally has represented some of the highest expressions of W.H. Smith's various Pinot Noirs. Gentle and yet complex, it opens with notes of raspberries and cherries accented with mushrooms and minerals. There's a deep, brooding earthiness, along with all sorts of spiced orange-rind and sandalwood notes. A great effort, and one of the best Pinots of the vintage. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Terlato has mastered the art of crafting Bordeaux-style red wines that scream Napa Valley. The style is the modern one of exceptional ripeness, softness and sweetness, generously oaked and slightly high in alcohol. Here, you'll find deep flavors of blackberries, mocha, black currants, olives and toast. It's ready to drink now, and should develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: How this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend manages to be softly delicious, yet structurally brilliant is its mystery and art. The winemaker took grapes from St. Helena, Howell Mountain, Rutherford and Yountville and blended them seamlessly. It's one of the most opulent wines of the vintage with blackberry, currant and mineral flavors set like jewels in a crown of tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An impressive Cabernet, flashy and dramatic in the \\\"cult\\\" style. It's smooth and velvety, with imposingly rich tannins that frame ripe, pure black currant, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis, dark chocolate and anise flavors. There's a lot of oak, too, but it's in keeping with the wine's volume. Should develop over the next 15 years, but you can certainly drink it now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red currant, blackberry and cedar aromas mingle in the glass. The focused, elegantly structured palate delivers juicy black cherries, crushed raspberries, tobacco and white pepper alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. A licorice note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of black currant, cedar, eucalyptus and dried Mediterranean herbs lead the nose of this full-bodied blend of 64% Cabernet Sauvignon, 26% Cabernet Franc, 5% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot.

The palate combines dried cherries, black currants and blueberry with a lavish amount of black pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the region's top producers excels at exploring single-vineyard bottlings, and this is one of the best. A reductive nose of burnt rubber sinks into a fantastic menthol character, laid across plump black currants. The palate thrives on a minty blackberry element and complex black pepper and creosote flavors. A strong tannic structure ensures the best sipping 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of bluish-black fruit, blue iris, menthol and aromatic herbs lead the nose of this 65% Sangiovese and 35% Cabernet Sauvignon blend. The palate offers dried black cherries, blackberries, coffee, tobacco and sage alongside firm, polished tannins. A note of ground aniseed closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from organically farmed grapes, it starts with aromas of mature black fruit, turned soil, blue flower and spice. The succulent palate delivers fleshy black cherry accented with notes of vanilla, Mediterranean herbs and cinnamon-spice alongside fine but tightly-knit tannins. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opening aromas recall underbrush, red berry, white mushroom, truffle and thyme with a whiff of leather. The palate offers restrained wild cherry accented with white pepper, mint and sage alongside tightly knit tannins. While the tannins need to unwind, this wine isn't made for long-term cellaring. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: To call this Cabernet muscular is an understatement. It's a mixed martial arts wine that kicks butt and takes no prisoners. The fruit is immensely forward and ripe in cherries and currants, and the tannins are as strong as anything out of the valley. Give it until 2020 to begin with.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas recall pine forest, balsam, black berries, sandalwood and menthol. The palate delivers rich red and black cherry layered with black pepper, toast and chocolate alongside bracing, teeth-coating tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers aromas recalling wood shop, coconut, French oak and menthol while the palate offers cranberry, espresso, star anise and a green note of powdered sage. Tightly wound, assertive tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, cellar floor, porcini mushroom and a whiff of menthol lead the nose. The palate is on the raw side, offering sour cranberry, dried herb and star anise alongside assertive, rather grainy tannins that leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas suggesting toast, coconut and roasted coffee bean. The palate is rather raw, offering sour cherry and espresso alongside raspy tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of French oak, vanilla, baking spice and steeped plum. The one-dimensional palate shows dried black cherry, sour cranberry and espresso with close-grained but not very persistent tannins that dry out the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a basket of ripe raspberry and strawberry in this earthy, single-vineyard designated wine, an earthiness that doesn't let go. Truffle and damp forest meet in the middle to introduce dusty, dense tannins that will benefit from time and air.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a dense, rich and soft wine, mostly Cab Franc, with 13% Petit Verdot, 4% Cabernet Sauvignon and 3% Malbec. The PV shows through in the wine's thickness and color, followed by flavors of caramel, graham cracker and billowing campfire. The power is intense.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Classic structured, firm and soft at the same time, with a lyrical, creamy mouthfeel. The tannins are evident now, but that is characteristic of a young Georges, and the reason it ages so well. The depth of blackberries, cherries and currants is unreal and persistent. This is one for the cellar and will age for at least a decade and probably far longer. Try to keep your hands off it until after 2011.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Our wine of the year in 2007 (the '04 El Puntido) is back with a vengeance in the 2005 vintage. This is a deep-fruited modern specimen with that elusive mix of floral, fruit and meaty characteristics. The palate is ripe and everlasting, with berry, coffee and hickory flavors. Long and calm on the finish, with amazing texture. An excellent encore to the prior year's achievement.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With the exact same rating as the awesome 2004, this new vintage of Aurus is an unbridled winner. It's a little creamy and sweet on first blush, but time and air reveals its darker, more serious side. Flavors of blackberry, barbecued beef and fudge tell all you need to know about ripeness and richness, and among the new classics of Rioja, Aurus is one of the leaders. Drink now and over the next three years. It's not really for long-term cellaring.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deeply impressive on every level, from the profound, inviting aromas of currants and fine oak to the mouthfeel, which is plush and important. Encased in a superb structure of acidity and firm tannins are ripe, complex flavors of currants, violets, olive tapenade and oatmeal raisin cookies. Completely dry, this beautiful wine should age well for six years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Duckhorn's Three Palms bottling is one of the oldest and most consistent Merlot vineyard designations in California and this is a classic example. The wine always is very tannic. But the '05 is dry and rich and complex in mineral-laden cherries and currants, with just the right application of new oak. You can decant it now for several hours and enjoy with a dramatically charred steak, but it will develop beautifully through 2011, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous Vin Santo with richly caramelized flavors and extraordinary smoothness, opulence and persistency. Its modern and round\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094there are no sharp points here\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and absent are those resin or tar-like flavors you sometimes find. Instead this is an absolutely pure expression of caramel delight.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured red offers scents of perfumed berry, rose, leather, an earthy whiff of game and a balsamic note. The chewy palate offers juicy black cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, tobacco and dark spice alongside ripe, velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this atypical yet awesome blend of 68% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Petite Sirah, 5% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec shows blackberries, beef char, pencil lead, coffee beans and a touch of dried dill on the nose. Though flavors are still unfolding, there's plenty of blueberry, violet, lavender, soy, dried strawberry and night jasmine on the palate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A Cabernet-heavy blend with 7% Sangiovese and 3% Petit Verdot, this wine marks the twentieth vintage of the producer's flagship wine, sourced from both its estate Cloudy's Vineyard and several Beckstoffer heritage sites. Black and green olives dance on the nose and palate first, followed by a concentration of cedar, pencil lead and black tea. It's powerful without being overly concentrated.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a small parcel of 41-year-old vines in the Muraires vineyard. It has concentration, richness and a structured character that suggests aging potential. Of course, this impressive wine is ready to drink now for its freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and concentrated in red cherry, cigar and plum, this demurely approachable and enjoyable wine has the legs to age. Structured and tightly drawn, it holds a tannic overbite that eases in the glass. Cellar through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very structured and dark, this is a wine for the long haul. It is concentrated and balanced, still very young and only just hinting at the black fruits that show the rich potential of this wine. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Maple-tinged oak aromas are huge and frame equally massive black-fruit scents. A tight clampy palate needs time to soften and expand; it's hard and unyielding now. Flavors of black fruits, coffee, chocolate and heavy oak finish firm and peppery, with a reprise of grabby, grating tannins. Drink from 2020 through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of tree bark, braised turnip and smoky black plum are rooty. This feels gritty and borderline astringent due to massive drying tannins. Savory earthy tarry blackberry flavors end with a hard tannic clamp. Drink this hefty brute from 2018 through 2035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas of forest floor, leather, graphite, chopped mint and an earthy whiff of soil on this elegant red. The structured, medium-bodied palate delivers dark cherry, raspberry compote, star anise, espresso and a toasted note. It's balanced, with firm close-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A ripe bold wine with generous black fruits, it is a blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. Dark and concentrated, it brings together rich fruitiness and firm tannins that will allow it to age. Drink from 2018. The wine comes from a vineyard that is currently in biodynamic conversion.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the few Pinot Noir plantings in Paso, this wine is hearty on the nose, with black cherry, black plum, bay leaf, forest berry, balsamic reduction and a rugged earthiness. It's thick on the palate, where strong licorice spice meets with flavors of caramelized beef in a black-plum sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Perfumed berry, fragrant blue flower and a hint of toasted hazelnut lead the way. On the taut palate, notes of star anise, white pepper and coffee bean accent a core of juicy red berry. Firm but refined tannins provide the elegant framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is textured, with a firm backdrop to the ripe white fruits. Acidity cuts through everything, giving a fragrant character. Drink this developing wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light in color but heavy in oak, Alcineo is a modern Tuscan red that puts big emphasis on wood-driven aromas of spice and vanilla. There are some bright cherry and citrus flavors on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, modern wine that delivers thick oak renderings stacked tall against smaller offerings of black fruit. Aromas of leather, spice and vanilla are dominant, and the wine is characterized by firm tannins. Drink after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in an understated classic style, this wine has a woody persistence of dried herb and mountain sage amid a grip of dusty tannin. Pencil shavings and red currant provide a yin and yang of structure and subtle character.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Given the poise and complexity, it's hard to believe this is the firm's entry-level Barolo. It opens with alluring aromas of wild berry, forest floor, new leather, menthol and purple flower while the full-bodied palate delivers crushed raspberry, morello cherry, mint and star anise. Firm refined tannins and bright acidity give it a structured finesse as well as balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a shockingly good wine. The aromas draw you into the glass, with vibrant notes of capers and Kalamata olives, brine, smoke meat, mineral, black pepper and earth.

It's a savory delight.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, chopped mint, sage, tobacco and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find on this. Firmly structured and youthfully austere, the palate delivers red cherry, raspberry compote, anise and clove framed in vibrant acidity and tightly-woven tannins that give it a firm finish. It needs time to fully come together and develop complexity.

The acidity is weaved throughout and entirely supportive, uplifting the fruit to greater heights of freshness and focus.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy, wooded and herbal, this full-bodied wine is deliciously layered in plum, cherry and blackberry, well composed and sourced from a site in Yountville. The grippy texture is accented in dark chocolate that gives velvety lushness that lasts through the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe berry, menthol, licorice and tobacco aromas mingle with whiffs of new leather and truffle. The delicious palate shows both generous fruit and restrained elegance, doling out raspberry jam, anise, clove, vanilla and dried herb framed in firm fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blends vineyards from across the valley, successfully capturing a compact and full-bodied explosion of black cherry and chocolate that benefits from bright, balanced acidity. Though offering depth and concentration, it finds a focused freshness that adds length and breadth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Velvety smooth, this wine seduces from the get-go, robust in black fruit, tea and delicate offerings of rose petal and lavender. Intensely full bodied, it retains a balance of bright, natural acidity that tames the spicy tannin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rose, iris, ripe red berry and aromatic herbs are some of the aromas you'll discover in this wine.

Bright acidity provides balance. Drink 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932043.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine, with its firm tannins and solid structure, is still young.

On the finish are touches of bittersweet chocolate and dried herb.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich almost to the point of chunky; aromas of coffee and new oak announce its New World style, and then come blackberry, chocolate and smoked-meat flavors. This wine is probably shocking to the old guard, but if tastes this good, drink it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This excellent wine represents a model for straddling the line between the past and current styles of Brunello. The cherry and raspberry fruit gets a kick from oak-based notes of charcoal and vanilla. Hold for at least four years, if possible.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Splendid from the gun, and classy. Early aromas of hard spices, mineral and matchstick announce some young oak, but that shortly dissipates, revealing a tight cherry and dark-chocolate bouquet. This model Brunello is impeccably balanced through the palate and onto the finish, which features a huge mix of pepper, licorice, baked fruit and vanilla. Hold at least until 2006.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lovely, with its own version of perfume exuding from the glass. Additional rose and berry notes lead to a silky palate featuring prune, flourless chocolate torte and coffee. The back end is tighter and heavier than the front, which bodes well for its future. Made in the modern style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full, classy and exciting from the first sniff to the last essence of the finish.

Best to drink it soon, in the fullness of youth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, dark and lush, with liqueur-like aromas wafting upward from a sea of purple. An obvious entry into the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cmodern\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d category of Brunello. There's jammy, mouthcoating fruit and only modest acidity. Detractors may find it heavy and bruising, but fans will adore its weight and creaminess.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truly classy, with a deep nose of earth, tar and pure berry fruit.

Hold until 2006.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Ruffino, this Brunello is ripe yet earthy, with a touch of forest and moss to the nose. It may be softer and riper than many, but it's definitely balanced. Meanwhile, fine black cherry and plum fruit steals the palate, which also dishes hints of chocolate and fennel. Good tannins and grip ensure its longevity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very big, rich, dense Pinot Noir, and some will fault it for having the high alcohol and full body that are characteristic of Cabernet. Nonetheless, this is immensely complex and dramatic, offering wave after wave of concentrated black cherry and red currant, with notes of bacon and sweet oak. Gets better and more attractive as it warms in the glass.

It has ripe black-currant and berry flavors, laced with acidity and dry, dense tannins. Its richness  is still developing. This has considerable aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Not showing much pleasure right out of the bottle, with a sharp, tannic mouthfeel. There's a deep core of black currant fruit that veers into overripe raisins. Might age, but it's risky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Refosco, this robust red has a shy nose that eventually reveals prune and a whiff of ground green pepper. The dense palate offers mature plum, vanilla and a hint of cocoa alongside the heat of evident alcohol and evolved tannins. Drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of fruit from Seven Hills (75%), Octave (21%) and Pepper Bridge vineyards, this wine shows intriguing aromas of anise, cassis, herb and woodspice. It still seems to be in its shell. The flavors are dense and supple, rich but restrained with the tannins combed to a fine sheen.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from some of the oldest vines in the valley, planted in 1977. Aromas of pear, hay and hazelnut lead to stone-fruit and butterscotch flavors that are light and elegant in style with a very pretty sense of balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Though it's a niche variety in the state, Carmen\\u00c3\\u00a8re has always been a flagship wine for this winery. This one is all varietal, with aromas of herbs, freshly cut green and jalape\\u00c3\\u00b1o peppers.

At the moment, it's quite dry, acidic and oaky. Primary fruit flavors of raspberries and cherries should begin to develop bottle complexity by 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subdued aromas recalling grilled herb, orange peel and a hint of freshly picked rose come together on this. The palate offers sour cherry, mint and licorice alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a firm, rather astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, scorched earth, dried tobacco leaf and camphor aromas emerge in the glass. The tight, compacted palate isn't extremely expressive but eventually reveals suggestions of raw cherry, grilled sage, clove and a hint of orange peel alongside drying tannins that leave a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A new wine by father-son team Tom and Rob Sinton, whose forebears partnered with Louis Martini during Prohibition. This blends in Merlot and Petit Verdot from a handful of vineyards, including Stagecoach and Konrad.

Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Toast, truffle, coconut and oak aromas unfold on this robust wine. The densely concentrated palate shows dried black cherry, bitter chocolate and oak-driven spice alongside austere, teeth-coating tannins that leave an astringent finish. It doesn't have quite enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak sensations.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Weedy underbrush, leather, mature berry and a whiff of cellar floor open. The full-bodied but somewhat evolved palate shows toast, mocha, grilled mushroom and dried black cherry alongside tightly knit tannins. Give the tannins a few years to unwind but then drink sooner rather than later to catch what fruit richness remains.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The work of award-winning winemaker Renzo Cotarella shows through in this wine's modern, bright purple color, its new wood and ripe fruit aromas and in the juicy blackberry and berry fruit flavors. Yet it is certainly not just modern glitz: Lurking behind is the real heart of a tough, ageworthy, tannic Brunello, which promises a good 10 years at least before being ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Antonio Mastrojanni has made a classic, old-style Brunello. There is a chunky solidity to the wine, with black, tarry fruit over toasty, but not new wood, flavors. It is firm, robust and, at this stage, still very dry from fruit tannins. Like many Mastrojanni vintages, it needs time\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094in this case, at least 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Not quite as big as the B\\u00c3\\u00a2tard, Latour's Corton-Charlie is the house's flagship (the company owns 10 hectares of the grand cru) and most ageable wine. The 2000 boasts aromas of gunflint, pear, smoked meat and buttered toast. White peaches emerge on the palate, but the primary flavors are of minerals and spice. Finishes with tons of citrus and an almost tannic feel. Give it two or three years to begin to soften.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Modern, polished fruit and new wood flavors blend well in this wine. The fruit is clean, ripe, bright with sweetness and flavors of black cherries. The wine is generous, full and opulent, with softer tannins than many Brunellos. Despite this nod in the direction of an international style, the wine still has the classic Brunello power and potential for aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Emilia Nardi, daughter of Silvio Nardi, is doing all the right things at this huge estate, especially with the development of clonal selection and denser planting of the vines. Her 1997 is a modern, new wood-dominated wine, but it also shows beautifully judged ripe fruits and sweet acidity. The overall effect is of great elegance, with good long-term aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Mariani family has produced a hugely concentrated, wood-dominated wine with powerful smoky aromas and concentrated black, ripe, chunky fruit. It's heavy on the berries, both in the rustic, brambly nose and on the deep, tight, classy palate. Toasty flavors come through the fruit, but these will soften and blend in with aging. Unlike many Brunellos, this one is drinkable right now, but could be cellared for 10 years or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Not for the fainthearted, this is a huge, mouthfilling wine bursting with yellow plum, hazelnut and peach aromas, and accented by smoke, butter and toast.

Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A smooth, polished performance from this 100-acre estate. The 1997 is modern in style, exhibiting huge but not too-dominant wood aromas and flavors, balancing with sweet, ripe berry fruit and black cherry jam. This is a wine that should be accessible young in four or five years, but should certainly age well over the following 10 or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The large 246-acre estate is owned by Countess Noemi Cinzano, of the vermouth family.

Age for at least 10 years before drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hail the first vintage of this international-style blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from a new quality-minded producer near Arezzo. It's deep with saturated blackberry and hints of dried citrus rind and smoked meat. The round, full-bodied, ripe-fruit palate is sure to please fans of big, modern wines.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The name is a play on words. Merli is the plural of \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cblackbirds,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d and this wine is 100% Merlot. But it isn't for the birds. Black as night in the glass, with a brooding power that's confirmed on the palate. What's special about it is that unlike so many flabby Merlots, it carries Chianti-like acidity and an unbridled raciness. Excellent now with food, and it will age well, too.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Another wacky Riesling from Marc Kreydenweiss, this one somehow works. There's Asian spice here and an odd collection of oxidative aromas but also undeniable concentration and good length. Serve this unusual wine by itself or with Indian fare.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a simple but genuine rendition of Brunello with measured aromas of cherry, wild berry and Indian spice. There's more personality in the mouth, however, where the wine shows a soft, supple and smooth texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A quirky wine, but largely successful, with upfront tones of clove-spiced orange peel and baking bread followed by dried fruit notes in the mouth. The long finish is on the sweet side and winds down to a note of Asian candy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very big, extractedly fruity Bordeaux blend. Right now, it's tannic and sharp and dry, but it has explosive blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors. Rather too angular and awkward for complete enjoyment, but cellar for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years and try again.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very tannic and gritty now. Shuts the fruit down with a dry, sandpapery astringency. But what great fruit. It's rich in blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and mocha, and is bone dry. Could and should age, but there's a certain sharpness that makes you wonder.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toast, roasted coffee bean, ripe black skinned fruit and exotic spice lead the way on this forward, concentrated wine. The warm, dense palate offers blackberry jam, dried black cherry, roasted walnut and licorice while big, chewy tannins offers support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and robust, this opens with aromas of ripe berry, pressed rose, cake spice and a balsamic note.

The mouthfeel is dense, with rich flavors of black cherries, licorice and dark chocolate offering layers of complexity, rounded out by the right amount of tannins and acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of three grapes, this unusual ice wine merges bright fruit and floral components of Vidal Blanc and Muscat with the smoky, gamy tones of the hybrid grape Marechal Foch. It's intense with honey and apple flavor, but spiked with distinct whiffs of smoke and potpourri. Balanced with bright, orange acidity, it finishes with a hint of lemon-pith astringency.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Tuscan Merlot has a fragrance of ripe plum, berry and cocoa.

It doesn't have much complexity but it has very attractive fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a special cuv\\u00c3\\u00a9e, produced from the estate of the Prissette family. It is certainly rich and dense but it also has a crisp edge coming from the black-currant fruits. The tannins are still firm and young, underlining the weight of the wine. With a final dry edge, the wine has considerable potential. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This light, elegant wine is perfumed like a rose garden, joined by lavender and dried herb. Its light take is supported by integrated tannin and a lurking tease of smoky meat and toasted oak that adds savoriness to its ethereal character.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense aromas of rose, chopped aromatic herb and a balsamic note set the tone on this fragrant red.

A blend of fruit from Atlas Peak and Rutherford, the wine is a barrel selection from the winery's regular 2010 output, and accounts for only about 20% of total production. The Cabernet Sauvignon is mixed with a little Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

The grapes come from various sources, including St. Helena and Atlas Peak, showing winemaker Tom Hinde's mastery of the art of blending.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is made from 100% Cabernet grown in the St. Helena estate vineyard. The wine is exceptionally pure and delicious, rich in black currant, chocolate, black cherry and lots of toasty new French oak. The all-important tannins are exquisitely ripe and as fine as velvet. Nowhere near ready, this wine wants a good eight years in the cellar, and will gradually evolve through the mid-2020s, at the very least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here we have a fascinating wine that's elegant and opulent, massive and controlled, flattering yet elusive, all at once. That combination of opposites gives it intellectual interest, a wine worth thinking and talking about. Technically, it's dry, fairly high in alcohol and oaky. The 100% Cabernet grapes off the estate are incredibly concentrated in black currants and cassis, showing their sunny, high elevation origins on Pritchard Hill. The wine is not perfect. There's a certain hollowness mid-palate, which has to be attributed to the challenging vintage.

The wine is absolutely dry, mouthwatering in acidity, and vastly complex. There's a touch of smoky, vanilla-scented French oak, but the fruit flavors star.

The wine is ideal now and should evolve for many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine abounds with intensity, richness and power as well as mouthwatering freshness. It is very ageworthy and certainly the most impressive wine from Henri Bourgeois, a tour de force of Sauvignon Blanc.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This stunning wine opens with a multifaceted fragrance of underbrush, leather, spice, woodland berries and violets, with a whiff of mint.

There is still a toast character here, with apricots and pear on top of the citrus, but it is still only just developing. In 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 years, it will be a magnificent wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine shows growing intensity the longer it stays in the glass and a very silky, polished feel in the mouth. Aromas include red fruit, spice and rosemary: this is a beautiful, balanced wine that will have a long life in your cellar.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: L'Apparita is a divine and delicate expression of Merlot with rich layers of black cherry, blackberry, spice, mocha, cedar, exotic spice and polished stone that are seamlessly woven together. The wine hits the palate with the softness and richness of the world's best Merlots and leaves a fading impression of fruit and spice that can be counted in many long, delicious minutes. Hold until 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This beautiful vintage of Paleo (an oak-aged expression of Cabernet Franc) shows dark, inky intensity and loads of mature black fruit, spice, plum, prune and blackberry. It is extremely smooth and rich with a long-lasting fade that consists of fruit and clove-like flavors. Yet, the tannins are still firm, so put this wine aside in your cellar for at least five years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: No doubt you will very much enjoy this super Tuscan blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese. The wine is rich, smooth and opulent: The quality of the fruit is also excellent with background shadings of black mineral, mature cherry, clove, rum cake, smoked ham and cola.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the richest Cabernets of the vintage. Amazingly soft and velvety in the mouth, yet there's a solid grip of acidity and tannins that balance the richness. The flavors are extraordinary, ranging from blackberry and cherry-pie filling through currant liqueur and milk chocolate to leather. So decadent now, it's hard to resist, but should develop for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Siepi is a gorgeous super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Merlot that exhibits richness, intensity and purity. This is a luscious and opulent expression with deep aromas of cherry, blackberry, chocolate, espresso bean and spice. The finish is super long and delicious.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In terms of overall quality this is the best yet from this sea-facing estate in coastal Tuscany. The blend sees Cabernet Sauvignon enhanced by Merlot and Cabernet Franc and the overall effect is one of impressive intensity and sophistication. The finish is velvety rich and smooth.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Fruit was picked later than normal and the Masseto Merlot does indeed show mature aromas of black cherry, ripe blackberry, earthy iron and polished stone. The intensity and purity are amazing and the wine is sophisticated, soft and very rich on the finish. It is already showing beautiful evolution in the glass.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a lovely fragrance of perfumed berries, violets, incense and sweet cake spices. Cinnamon, clove and white pepper accent the succulent red cherry and wild raspberry palate. It's fresh and elegant, with a smooth texture and supple tannins. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This proprietary blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, Grenache, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon delivers a deep and layered nose. Wild blackberry jam, pine pitch and white sage converge, like a walk through the California chaparral. The acidity is amazingly vibrant, with flavors of bright purple fruit, pepper and crushed herbs on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, leather, crushed blue flower, incense and balsamic notes lead the nose on this gorgeous wine. The palate delivers succulent black cherry layered with white pepper and clove alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932034.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This elegant wine opens with a floral fragrance of rose petals, violets, perfumed berries and cake spices. Black pepper and clove accent the juicy dark cherry and black raspberry flavors, while assertive but refined tannins give structure. Drink after 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This robust, refined wine, dusted in tiny additions of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, is impressively crafted, seamless in approach and velvety in texture. Juicy blackberry and black currant, along with softer notions of black cherry, highlight buoyant acidity and a lush, thick finish. This should show best between 2023 and 2028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enhanced with 5% Roussanne, this bottling offers deep blueberry and blackberry fruit on the nose alongside touches of black licorice, oak smoke, sandalwood and caramel. Hints of juniper and pine needle show on the thick palate, giving a bitter complement to the thick and unctuous blueberry and fudge flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While this Stephan\\u00c3\\u00a9 Derenoncourt wine has dry tannins, it also has ripe fruit and blackberry flavors. Concentrated and firm for now, from 18 months in barrel, it will develop well to give a rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This ripe Carignan-Garnacha from a warm year smells of prune, vanilla, cola and violet petals. The palate is open and wide, with raw tannins and a sensation of resiny oak. Flavors of black plum, red and black currants, toast and barrel spice finish toasty, chocolaty and much like coffee, with tannic grab and just enough acidity to keep things lively. Drink through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tannic, dry and acidic now, this doesn't offer much of the immediate opulence found in many California Pinot Noirs. The richness is in there, but it's buried. The sweet core of cherries, currants, exotic spices, mushrooms and minerals is just waiting for time to release it. Cellar this for 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An interesting blend of Bovale, Carignano and Cannonau (three of the great indigenous grapes of Sardinia), this opens with aromas of bramble, fresh herb, black olive and dried ginger. Soft berry fruit is backed by a fresh, menthol-tinged finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, rich, fruity Cabernet. It's quite a delicious mouthful of jammy blackberries, red currants, milk chocolate and cedar, but it wants some 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years in the cellar. The grapes come from vineyards all over the valley.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Licorice, schist, wild herbs and spicy berry fruit form an alluring bouquet. The palate is jammy but firm, with mouthfilling tannins and schisty flavors of blackberry that come with a fine herbal streak. Meaty and tannic but balanced and deep; a classy taste of Priorat to drink now through 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A wine to cellar. With powerful tannins and near perfect balance, it's extraordinarily ripe and rich in blackberries and currants, with hints of minerals and spices. Very dry, it feels vital from the first taste to the long finish. The vineyard is north of Yountville, which puts it in a cooler area. Should develop bottle complexity over the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Defines the Paso Robles style of enormously ripe fruit and softness. Incredibly rich in brown sugar, blackberry jam, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, it's not particularly subtle, but delicious now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a thick, inky texture, and clean flavors of dark prune, cassis and blackberry preserves. The finish is rich, long and supple.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Colli Euganei is an up-and-coming wine region located in a volcanic chain of hills outside the city of Padua. This expression of Moscato is sweet and enduring, with aromas of yellow rose and jasmine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This small-production Rioja (under 200 cases) is focused, minerally and lightly charred up front, with blackberry, cassis and vanilla aromas. A flush, bright not-too-heavy palate offers lively black cherry and blackberry flavors accented by creamy vanilla and char. A medium-long, elegant finish with healthy acidity indicates that this will age nicely through about 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, cooking spice, tilled soil, new leather and violet are some of the aromas you'll find on this vibrant red. The polished palate offers tart red cherry, strawberry fresh herb and espresso alongside supple tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From both hillside sites and valley floor, this entry-level wine is impressively made and ready to be enjoyed. A mix of rose petals and raspberry preserves surround a good grip of tannin and savory tease of clove, before a lengthy finish adds to the experience. It's made with 2% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: It's safe to say that Gianfranco Soldera's style is only appreciated and understood by Brunello purists. The wines are as thorny and complex as the argumentative, cantankerous man who makes them. For one, this wine has big volatility but the magic here is that those pungent direct aromas translate into bright aromatic vibrancy and buoyancy. In fact, its intensity and the careful balance between acidity and structure is unmatched.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon gives this wine a luscious, elegant mouthfeel, with classic currant and cedar flavors. Syrah brings a gamy, leathery note, with white pepper accents. The result is an interesting, complex young wine of power and authority. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a rich, rounded wine with pure red berry aromas. The initially soft tannins has a dryness that creeps up as the fruit increases in its richness. Layers of wood spice support the fruit rather than dominating.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This classic Barolo opens with aromas of ripe dark berry, forest floor and a balsamic note. On the palate, clove, pepper and licorice back up a core of crushed black cherry and raspberry. It's young but already remarkably well balanced, with tightly knit, refined tannins and nervous acidity. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An elegant wine, this is a blend of vines from both the cool and the warm side of the vineyard. It is soft with ripe mango as well as sliced apple freshness. The texture is already well integrated, both tight and mineral on one side and rich on the other. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dried rose petal, underbrush, leather, and a balsamic note are just some of the scents you'll find on this firm, well-structured red. On the palate, licorice, clove and crushed herb accent the core of crushed black cherry while velvety tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This boasts alluring aromas of pressed rose, perfumed berry, baking spice and a balsamic note. The elegantly structured palate is still young but already expresses bright red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, menthol and chopped herb. Firm, polished tannins and fresh acidity provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, rose petal, tilled soil, aromatic herb, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this intense, full-bodied wine. The palate is still tight, showing wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and tobacco alongside firm tannins that need time to unwind. It already has depth but will develop even more complexity over the next decade and more. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from old vines, this is a beautiful wine. It has great structure, minerality and concentration along with a full-bodied richness that is developing well. Combined with the ripe yellow fruits, they give an opulent wine that will age for several years. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas suggesting toast, menthol, steeped cherry and a whiff of iris. The palate is rather shy, showing oak, licorice and clove but not much fruit richness. Bracing tannins clench the finish. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe berry, blue flower, fresh rose and aromatic herb aromas come together in the glass along with a whiff of pipe tobacco. The palate offers juicy dark berry, chopped mint and star anise alongside assertive tannins and modest acidity. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toasted hazelnut, espresso and eucalyptus aromas lead the nose. The bracing palate is tight and rather closed, but eventually reveals licorice, tart cherry and orange peel alongside grainy tannins. An anisette note closes the warm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toast, sage, hazelnut and a hint of eucalyptus. The palate offers sour cherry, strawberry jelly, anise and orange peel alongside assertive tannins that leave a dusty finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 2004 vintage is certainly mature, but with a light touch it is still attractive to drink. Mushroom and spice are lifted by juicy acidity. The dryness at the end shows it is ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A soft, fleshy wine to drink now. It has a fancy mouthfeel, with a firm hit of tannins and acidity, and lush flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and spices.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tremenel has an earthy fragrance of underbrush, tobacco and ripe black fruit with a whiff of spice. The palate delivers a tight core of black cherry layered with raisin, white pepper, nutmeg and cocoa backed up by bracing but refined tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cab is in a somewhat awkward state now, poised between fresh blackberry and cherry fruit and mature notes of dried fruits and mushrooms. That tension lends it interest. The grapes come from Calistoga and Carneros, which also gives a dynamic play between lushness and acidity. It's a fine, stylish wine for drinking now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the classic dessert wine from Valpolicella. The palate is dense and concentrated, with plum cake, prune and fig layered with spice and pipe tobacco. It's velvety smooth but also has fresh acidity, making it a perfect match for seasoned cheeses or to sip on its own after dinner.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard wine is a showcase of ripeness\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094fruity and smooth with great plum and wild strawberry flavors. It's intensely structured and dense on the palate, however, making it a wine for aging. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of raspberry, cherry, vanilla and new oak richness in this Pinot Noir, and it's dry and silky. Would score higher except for intrusive acidity that cuts through the mouth like a scalpel. That makes it unbalanced, even though it's delicious.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tight, compact and rubbery on the nose, with a mineral, medicinal edge to the black-fruit aromas. Snappy and hard on the cheeks, with midland berry fruit and a scouring, juicy, woody finish. Lots of red fruit but scratchy and a little medicinal.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: How's this for exotic: this red blend is made from the vinifera grapes Saperavi (from the former Soviet Georgia) and Sereksiya Charni (generally from Moldova). On the nose, the wine displays clove, tart berry, raspberry and black pepper, and on the palate, like flavors and solid tannins. There's a touch of dried tea to the blend and a decent finish, but the wine needs time to age--consider holding it for 5-10 years for the complexity to unfold. Overall, an appealing and interesting choice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Consumers need to be warned that this Zin has 16.3% alcohol, which puts it nearly in Port territory. That aside, it's a good example of its style, which lots of people like. Dry and well-structured in acids and tannins, it shows rich flavors of red and black currants, anise, cola and crushed pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: La Scolca's Black Label Gavi presents refined and elegant tones of peach, dried apricot, honey and white almond. The wine rests on the lees in order to absorb more complexity and texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This tight and firm Barbaresco from the Rio Sordo cru exhibits an orange tinge to its garnet color and shows aromas of licorice, exotic spice, old leather and dried tobacco leaf. The wine seems older than it actually is, but those polished tannins should pull it forward a few more years at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak and superripe fruit collaborate to make this wine taste like a fruity granola bar, with raspberries, blackberries, roasted almonds, caramel and cinnamon spices. It's a bit obvious now, too young and fresh for subtlety, especially at this price. Could develop nuances over time. Give it 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years and try again.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is fruity and crisp. It is also full of ripe apple and rich pear fruits that give density and fine concentration to this delicious impressive wine. The acidity adds brightness while the minerality comes from the taut steely texture. Drink this wine now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine leads with new leather, dark spice, iris and eucalyptus scents. Its linear, slender palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and ground clove\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094flavors that are held taut by fine-grained tannins and racy acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Menthol, new leather, blue flower and sage aromas lead this wine's nose, along with a whiff of toast. Taut and savory, it offers crunchy red berry, star anise, ground clove and a hint of tobacco on the palate. Youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity lend structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tightly wound on the nose, this wine eventually releases blackcurrant and blueberry fruit along with aromas of black rock and turned earth. The palate is dense with black peppercorn, char and asphalt, lifted by hints of violet. Since the structure is dense and tannic, it will be fun to watch this wine emerge over the years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A pretty, polished Cabernet, rich and spicy in jammy black raspberry and cherry fruit. Ripe, smooth Napa tannins give it an upscale mouthfeel. Seems best over the next 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firmly tannic, solid and chunky wine. The ripe strawberry flavors are balanced by firm tannins and a dark edge of plum skins. Should be aged for another year.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, rich, thick young wine, impressive in sheer fruity extraction. Shows massive blackberry, currant, anise, black pepper and sandalwood flavors, with a bit of funk. The tannins are strong and refined. Could age well. Tasted three times, with inconsistent results.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine that seems to take the softness of Chambolle-Musigny too far. It has sweetness and flavors of raspberry juice, leaving no room for structure or acidity. Drink now, because this wine is too open to last.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plush blackberry, fennel, mocha, char and peppercorn aromas show on the nose of this bottling from longtime friends Paul Quinn and James Schreiner. Dried plum skin, cherry and elderberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with tannins and turns savory with charred beef, charcoal and tobacco flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, toast and black spice aromas lead the nose, accented by whiffs of espresso. The palate offers licorice, clove, dried cherry and vanilla notes, while a backbone of fine-grained tannins provides support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cedar, bold berry and cassis aromas come with an exotic note of sandalwood. In the mouth, this feels alert, bright and grabby, with a full load of muscular tannins and acidity. Flavors of spiced blackberry, coffee and chocolate are toasty and a touch burnt in character on the finish. Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 75% Grenache, 15% Syrah and 10% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre offers intriguing cherry candy, rhubarb and hibiscus scents, with touches of exotic cinnamon and woodsmoke. Caramel and baked cherry flavors mark the cherry pie-like palate, dusted with star anise and clove over a solidly tannic frame.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A textured wine, it's still very crisp, tight and closed up, only just hinting at a more fruity side. Waiting a few years will reveal the delicious citrus, peach and vanilla flavors that will show how generous and rich this wine really is. Don't touch before 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This luminous, ruby colored wine opens with a lovely bouquet of violet, rose, new leather, woodland berry and baking spice. The bright palate is loaded with finesse and smooth tannins, deliveing crushed red cherry and wild strawberry accented by clove and cinnamon. Enjoy now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The light, stony soil of Les Lavi\\u00c3\\u00a8res produces structured, tight and firm wines, unlike many of the softer wines from Savigny. With new wood and licorice flavors, it is darkly textured and firm. The red fruits are still developing, showing the rich potential of the wine. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and aromatic, this black label reserve displays excellent power and concentration. A dense core of cassis, licorice and espresso is brightened with vivid acidity, slowing fading through a long, smoky finish. Wait until 2016 for optimum enjoyment.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ferguson is L'Ecole's newest estate vineyard, and this Bordeaux-style blend marks its single-vineyard debut. It's 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc, grown at 1,500 feet in almost pure basalt. The minerality is a signature trait, along with raspberry, cassis and wild cherry fruit flavors. This seems sure to improve by 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Balsam wood, coconut, tobacco and black-fruit aromas feed into a lush, easygoing palate with smooth tannins and lots of weight.

Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From vines averaging 50 years of age, this is powerful, ripe and concentrated. It has dark black fruits, red berries that give acidity, and a richly fruity structure. It punches well above its village appellation. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Luscious prune and blackberry aromas come with complex notes of graphite, toast and tobacco. The palate on this 80-case, high-end Tinto Fino is about as full as they come while still maintaining impeccable balance. Roasted berry, cassis and salty leather flavors are delicious but also challenging, while baked berry flavors, raw power and ripe tannins define the finish. Drink this outstanding Spanish wine from 2014 through 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: After two marginal vintages (2007\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009308), this is Emilio Moro and Ribera del Duero at their finest.

This wine, fortunately, succeeds. It does offer an explosion of blackberries, currants, cassis and mocha, but is grounded by a savory olive notes and minerality. Meanwhile, the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. It will be hard to keep your hands off it until 2020, but try.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich, complex, ageable Pinot from this increasingly well-regarded vineyard. It's a big, dark wine, explosive in raspberries, cherries and mocha, but retains a delicacy courtesy of its tannins and acids and some mysterious elegance from the soil. This is easily Guarachi's best Pinot ever, although it's also their most expensive. You get what you pay for. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows the power and finesse of this great vineyard. The cherry, persimmon, cola and baking spice flavors have the exotically feral notes of chamomile, game and mushrooms so typical of this vineyard and the Fort Ross area. So beautiful and deft now, it's hard not to pop the cork, but this Pinot will age well for at least 10 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cX\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d designation refers to the number of clones in this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. You have to search for the richness\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094buried so deeply now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094but it's there, like a pirate treasure of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur. Hard, thick and resistant now, it's framed by astringent tannins and a dryness that's almost arid. Charles Krug clearly built this wine to age, and there's no reason it shouldn't. Your window begins in 2018 and should last a very long time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The creamy, rich notes of freshly baked pear tart reach the senses first. Next the palate offers a soft, gentle and almost breezy freshness with citrus peel, floral overtones, creamy hints of shortbread and something primal like rock and stone.

Drink now until 2030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From the producer's estate vineyard on the Vaca Mountain range, this wine offers soft, generous tannin around a juicy core of cassis, dried currant, leather and cigar.

Oak-derived aromas of toasted almond and clove are delicate and well integrated.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Balifico stands apart thanks to its dark, rich appearance and generous aromas.

In contrast to the boldness of the bouquet, the palate is fine, polished and long-lasting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tropical fruit aromas lead to a peach- and apricot-flavored palate. It shows old-vine concentration, spice from having aged in wood and a generous, velvet-like texture that is balanced by a fine shot of lemony acidity. Age this for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its firmness and juicy red-fruit flavor, this wine is delicious to drink now, but it will also age for at least six years. This bottling demonstrates the structure and generosity of one of Beaune's most famous premier crus.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There is a ton of black pepper flavor in this stylish blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah. It also bears notes of licorice, sweet red currants, grilled prosciutto and sandalwood. This tastes so rich that it almost seems sweet, but it's actually dry and balanced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with soft and luscious fruit tones of cherry and blackberry jam. Leather and tobacco add a savory, masculine quality, and there's a tart red-fruit flavor that adds a touch of refreshing acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and tannic, with jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate and spices. Not showing much structure, and not going anywhere, so drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a Merlot-dominant blend, with 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc blended in.

Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas convey cedar, savory herb, earth, black licorice and cherry. The dark flavors are reserved in style but still display richness, supported by fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A big, burly, hedonistic wine, this offers layers of pronounced baked apple, pear and caramel.

The joy ride ends with a balanced sense of wet stone, fresh and refined.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo offers tobacco leaf, porcini mushroom, roasted coffee bean and espresso aromas. The palate delivers ripe plum and coffee notes, and ripe, round tannins. This isn't a very typical expression of Barolo, but it's enjoyable. It's already approachable. Drink it now and over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle aromas of dark fruit and leather give this wine a measured and timid first approach. The intensity builds with each swirl of the glass and the wine shows that typical Sangiovese Grosso tightness and acidity on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here is an easygoing and crisp Brunello from the cool 2008 vintage that shows lively berry nuances backed by savory touches of spice and black pepper. It's tight and compact without too much pulp or softness on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty coffee and tobacco aromas add weight and persistency to this garnet colored Brunello. There's fruit here in the form of cherry, pomegranate and dried raspberry but those savory notes at the back really add to the wine's overall complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fuligni delivers a bright and sharp Brunello with medium build and tight forest berry aromas. The acidity leaves your mouth as clean as a whistle, and the wine imparts lingering tones of chopped mint, cola and dried ginger on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak-driven tones of toasted spice, pipe tobacco and bitter chocolate are followed by balsam tones of licorice, cola and dried ginger. There's a touch of fruity richness followed by crisp acidity and forest berry.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sugarille (by Angelo Gaja) is among the top-scoring wines in Montalcino but this edition is weighed down by biting acidity that is characteristic of the 2008 vintage. Modern aromas of black cherry, chocolate and tobacco deliver intensity and power. But the freshness feels sharp and raw at the back of the mouth. Give this wine a few more years to evolve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an equal split of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Medium bodied, it's peppery in cassis, cedar, cinnamon and vanilla. Big, pillowy tannins fill the palate, staying firm and sizable through the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of two wines produced by this estate from old vines, this is a ripe, full wine that has a fine balance between ripe red-berry fruit and acidity.

Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured wine opens with an unusual blend of aromas that includes ripe black fruit, dill and chocolate. The palate offers velvety tannins and notes of tart blackberry, black cherry, fig and mature plum sprinkled with notes of cocoa.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'd never guess that this was rocking it so hard with 16.3% alcohol, as this wine achieves balance in the face of such boozy contents. The nose holds a blackberry core with rusty, spicier edges of star anise. These are followed by a palate of black cherry and cedar, with enough tannins to ensure evolving drinking until at least 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and smoky, it discloses fruit as well as solid tannins. The wine has power and density, with black fruits that show sweetness. It will be delicious but the structure does need to soften first. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark burgundy in color, it has an old-world soul, earthy and brooding in clove, mushroomy forest floor and a light texture of cherry, not what you'd expect from a big-time NASCAR guy. Restrained yet powerful.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: At this stage, this wine is closed and packed with acidity. But just wait for a few years and the ripe wood and yellow fruits will emerge. It's a full-bodied, rich wine that needs to round out.

Cherry, cassis and wood flavors dominate, and the tannins are quite astringent. Re-tasted over many hours it remained stubbornly hard and compact. Give this one some further bottle age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is tight with tannins and a dense texture. It has plenty of fruit underneath to allow this blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot to balance out.

Enjoy soon to catch the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pricey, yes, but Madrigal pulled out all the stops on this flashy wine, making it their best Cabernet ever. It's a big, tannic and dry wine, stuffed with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. Voluptuous and dramatic, but it needs age, possibly a lot. Give it a rest until 2015 and see how it's doing then.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Probably the best expressions of Cabernet Sauvignon from the Cefal\\u00c3\\u00b9 area of Sicily (north of Palermo). This beautiful estate, crowned by an ancient stone abbey, has seen a few difficult years, but thankfully, the vines remain productive. Gorgeous, rich and round, Litra delivers black cherry and chocolate flavors and velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In keeping with Sicily's Arab-European identity, Sultana is a thick and luscious dessert wine enhanced by attractive layers of cinnamon apple, toasted walnut and candied fruit. Golden Delicious apple and pear aromas are in the forefront, and the wine feels rich and smooth with soft touches of chewy sweetness on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Chardonnay remains dry and resistant in acids and tannins. The flavors are elusive, suggesting minerals and lemons, with plenty of brisk, citrusy acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and mushy in structure, with sweet, pie-filling flavors of berries that have a baked fruit edge, this Zin tastes like it was a victim of hot overripeness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tough, common wine, gritty in tannins, with superripe blackberry flavors that veer into bitter raisinskins and dark, unsweetened baker's chocolate. Not going anywhere.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this adds a handful of Petit Verdot for good measure. Smooth, round and approachable, it offers a powerful grip and dense black fruit, finishing with balanced acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 90% Pinot Nero and 10% Chardonnay, this opens with aromas of citrus zest, ripe orchard fruit, toast and a whiff of acacia flower.

The full-bodied, one-dimensional palate is rather evolved, offering raisin and clove alongside close-grained but not very persistent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: For a wine from this appellation, this is surprisingly soft. It has black fruits and tannins that are already softening. Spice and berry fruits are lifted by acidity. This fruity wine will be ready to drink from late 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with funky aromas of game, cured meat and wet animal fur. Rustic and lean, the astringent palate offers a suggestion of powdered sage and a balsamic note but lacks fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A traditional blend of Chardonnay (72%) and Pinot Nero, this luminous sparkling wine offers yeasty tones of fresh bread, mature apricot and caramel. It has good density and length and is perfect for the festive holiday season.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Elegant and clean, this Brut Sat\\u00c3\\u00a8n sparkler boasts a feminine side thanks to its soft perlage and delicate aromas of peach blossom and honeysuckle. It's an attractive and fresh wine that remains compact and composed to the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The alcohol is pretty high, but the wine is decadently rich and forward in pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate, seasoned with anise, cinnamon and pepper. Firm tannins give much-needed structure to this deliciously dry Cab Franc.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This sparkling wine has aromas of baked apricot, walnut, hay, citrus and oak. The palate is lean and dry, without enough fruit richness to support the oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With 17% Cabernet Franc added in, this wine is leathery, rustic and tightly tannic, with a sizable presence of oak. Soft, it finishes in a thickness of black cherry and stewy plum.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The immediate impression is that this wine is heavy, ripe and oaky.

Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth and juicy in red fruit with an edge of more savory cranberry, this wine from a great vineyard source rises to its occasion and to its site, offering high acidity, medium weight and a lingering, nearly spicy finish.

The palate proves very grippy, with flavors of sweet tar, boysenberry and black pepper throughout.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Classic Rioja aromas of rooty black fruits, vanilla, dill and herbs are the greeting on this full-force, saturated wine.

The tannins are dark, with some sweetness as well as final acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Poruzots offers a restrained version of Meursault, very structured, its texture severe and tight. Apple skin and green plum fruits go with the dry toast character. Age for a year for more ripe flavors to emerge.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: So ripely soft and delicious, it's drinkable now. Really ple Jean Edwardsases the palate with sweet blackberries, cherries and cassis, accented by smoky oak. Fortunately, there's enough of a tannin-acid balance to give structure to all this opulence. Could develop over the years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is very strong in blackberries, black currants and cedar. It's also quite tannic. Clearly a rich, well-grown wine, but marked by immaturity, with unintegrated sweet fruit and oak flavors. Needs a good six years to start to knit together.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, intense red-fruited wine, soft and voluptuous. The tannins are folded into the ripe fruits, giving a very approachable feel. The acidity is prominent at this stage but should soften in a year or two, and the wine is certainly worth aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Starts out a bit flat, with milk chocolate and raisiny aromas.

Drink from  2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is Doubleback's first vintage to include estate-grown grapes in the blend. Truffle, mocha and ripe purple-fruit scents explode from the glass.

Ripe red-fruit flavors are brightened by ample acidity, resulting in a sumptuous wine that also has enough tannins to age. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle notions of ripe peach circle above a compact, bundled palate of peach and spice: perhaps vanilla, perhaps pepper. The distinct but subtle sweetness on the palate is countered by a firm, focussed freshness which in turn contrasts with pleasant warmth. The dramatic palate draws you so far into its quicksand-like depth that you almost forget to notice the more ethereal, scented clouds of peach. Pure joy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromatics take time to come to the fore but they are definitely there: notes of lifted Poire William and ripe, golden-cheeked apricots are hinted at. The medium-sweet palate brings them out in full force, glowing with a ripe opulence tempered by freshness and a slight phenolic grip. There is a luminous quality to this wine, shining its way ahead into the future, guided by a seam of freshness and focus on the midpalate, echoing with bitter almond and more fruit.

Very great now, and should develop over the next 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful, brilliant but immature Cabernet. It's massively rich in blackberry and cherry pie filling, cassis, dark chocolate and fine, smoky oak flavors, wrapped into thick but fine, sweet tannins. Shows elegance and finesse despite the power, but needs time. Best after 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With so much intensity, botrytis and concentration, this is going to be impressive. It is still very young, at a closed stage, but the ripe currant as well as the honey dominate. Great wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Premi\\u00c3\\u00a8re Trie means a wine from the first selection of grapes during harvest. This wine, now firmly closed up, as is expected with Chenin Blanc, is headed towards an opulent future, even though the fruit is kept firmly in check by the long-term aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful young wine, notable for two things, its balance and generosity. Feels wonderfully structured, with superb tannins and a fine dose of acidity framing massive blackberry, currant, bacon, black pepper, mineral and sandalwood flavors. Bone dry, it's a superior Syrah that should develop over the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a big, juicy wine with high acidity and a taste of crisp, red fruit. Substantial tannins suggest cellaring through 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020 to elongate the young, puckering finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This barrique-aged, 100% Merlot opens with aromas of roasted coffee bean, vanilla, coconut and plum steeped in spirits. The palate delivers dried black cherry, espresso, licorice and oak extract alongside drying tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up so enjoy sooner rather than later. Drink through 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with earthy aromas of leather, overripe black fruit, meat juice and a whiff of barnyard. The palate delivers mature plum, black cherry, loam and game alongside astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah, with smaller dollops of Petite Sirah, Merlot and Malbec, this is a dark, inky wine, brawny in leather, clove and meat. Big-bodied and oaky, it finishes in a sea of brambly blackberry and wild game.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this is a good, smooth wine that shows its Napa origins in the ripeness of fruit and classy tannins. Floods the mouth with blackberries and oak. There's a certain sharpness that cuts through the richness and lasts through the finish, which may limit ageability, so drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This barrel selection, Keller's best, is an elaborate and complex Pinot Noir. It shows classic coastal acidity, with deep, delicious flavors of raspberries, cherries, mocha, licorice, spices and sweet sandalwood. The tannins are rich enough to let it age over the next six years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big, hard, tannic wine. It's so buttoned up, the question is whether it will age. Most of the signs say yes. It's gigantically rich in blackberries, cassis and chocolate, with a berried sweetness accented by the caramel of toasted oak. Acidity is just fine. On the other hand, the alcohol is notable, giving it peppery heat. A very fine, flashy, impressive wine, but its future is obscure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A concentrated, ripe wine, full of toasty new wood flavors as well as dark berry tannins and acidity. It is dense, full in the mouth and packed with ripe fruit. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark, spicy and deeply flavored, this Cabernet is dense and concentrated in blackberry and cassis flavors, with a stony minerality at its core. The fruit is so ripely expansive, it tastes sweet on the finish, yet the wine is utterly dry. It's good now despite the hard mountain tannins, but should begin to blossom after 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very similar to the 2006, Kameron's '07 Bordeaux blend, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is upfront in blackberry, cherry, cassis, oak and spice flavors. It's quite tannic, with a puckery astringency that suggests needed time in the cellar. Better after 2014.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A tiny-production wine at the producer's higher end of pricing and intent, this offers juicy red fruit around dense, sizable tannins that are on the way to being integrated and resolved. There's a softness on the palate and it finishes with a note of cinnamon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with enticing scents of rose, iris and perfumed berry. The firmly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, white pepper, licorice and clove alongside drying, austere tannins that leave a rather grainy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crushed stone, clove, dark-skinned berry and Mediterranean herb aromas emerge. The palate is rather shy, offering sour cherry, licorice, white pepper and mineral framed in firm acidity and assertive, fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coffee, toasted oak, coconut and raspberry confiture aromas lead the way. On the dense palate, dark chocolate, oak and licorice accent fleshy black cherry while fine-grained tannins provide support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense rose, iris and aromatic herb aromas are the highlight of this wine. The palate isn't as expressive, offering raw sour cherry, powdered sage and excruciatingly astringent tannins that dry out the mouth. It lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, toasted hazelnut and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The tightly wound palate is still rather closed and on the lean side in terms of fruit richness, but slowly reveals sour cherry, licorice and a note of ground pepper. A tannic backbone provides structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of espresso, underbrush, leather, dark spice, mature black-skinned fruit and a suggestion of oak lead the way. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, vanilla and star anise alongside fine-grained tannins that leave a dusty finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Complex and well balanced, this wine shows enticing aromas of fruits, spices and subtle herbs followed by tangy, dry, and slightly lean flavors like cranberry and rhubarb. It will be great with a roast fowl of some kind and should mellow more with time. Best after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, porcini mushroom and dried plum aromas lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers dried black cherry, raspberry confiture and licorice alongside assertive, tightly-packed tannins. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This release comes from the producer's own Durell Vineyard, specifically two blocks consistently used for this wine. Powerful ripeness and showy fruit rise on the nose and palate first, with an explosion of coconut water and burly oak. The wine was given 15 months in French oak, half of it new. Almonds, oranges and lemon rind combine before a dry finish. Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and creamy, this has rich pear and apple fruits lightly cut by more lemon flavors. The wine is fruity, textured with minerality and still young. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wild-berry, truffle, leather, menthol and sunbaked soil aromas lead the way. Tightly wound but ripe tannins wrap around the firmly structured palate, underscoring mature Morello cherry, black raspberry, white pepper, licorice and chopped Mediterranean herb. A subtle hint of game closes the finish. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This savory blend of 40% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah opens with aromas of roasted coffee bean, leather, tobacco and dark woodland berry. The chewy palate offers juicy plum, cassis and clove alongside polished tannins. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sunbaked earth, ripe berry, baking spice and a whiff of menthol meld in the glass. The juicy palate offers red cherry, pomegranate, star anise, mocha and a hint of tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe dark-skinned berry, forest floor and cooking spice aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of new leather. The chewy palate offers fleshy black cherry, cinnamon, vanilla and a hint of tobacco while polished tannins provide the framework. This is already accessible so no need to cellar it for years. Best through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This expression of Nero d'Avola paints a rosy picture of the future of this indigenous variety and Sicilian winemaking in general. Aged in large casks and cement, this is elegant and fine, with an extremely polished texture. The finish is marked by a note of dried berry fruit, plus warm, earthy tones of leather and dried spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is so smooth, rich and mellow, you hardly notice how intense the tannins are. But they are hard, and lock down the flavors of black currant and black licorice, plus the complex notes of minerals, roasted game and dark spices. Drink this Malbec-based blend now after decanting and over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brisk acidity brightens the ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, giving it a clean, lively mouthfeel. There's a jacket of tannins, but it's fine and easy, and oak brings just the right touch of sweet toast flavor. Lovely to drink now, and it should develop bottle complexities over the next 8\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This rare unclassified growth from Saint-Julien has all of the elegance you would expect, and it balances firm tannins with a classic black-currant flavor. It has dark, structured tannins, with layers of wood and acidity on the fragrant finish. Keep this for many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very rich and smooth in texture, like pure velvet, this Bordeaux-style blend has lots of tannins that are soft, ripe and easy. It offers extraordinary waves of blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and caramelized oak flavors. Drink soon for maximum enjoyment.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rose, violet, toast, underbrush, menthol and perfumed berry aromas lead the way on this wine. The palate offers dried black cherry, eucalyptus, ground black pepper and dried sage alongside bracing, rather astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light and clear in color and texture, this wine opens in dirt and earth, along with a touch of baked strawberry. Smooth, juicy and long-lasting, it shows off the vintage's warmer leanings, and is medium bodied and densely lengthy.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a lean Dominus, showing the difficulties of the vintage. It's dry and tannic, with black currant, cherry and cassis flavors that are wrapped in strong, hard tannins. It's a good wine, but lacks the r ich complexity you expect from this property.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rancia Riserva opens with ripe plum, red currant and bell pepper aromas. The palate shows flavors of black fruit, chocolate and soy sauce alongside coffee and oak notes. It has nervous energy and intensity, but should develop nicely over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows the impeccable viticulture and winemaking talent that mark all of Jarvis's red wines. The tannins and acidity are considerable, giving the cherry flavor such a nice bite. A lovely wine to drink now with steak or Italian-inspired beef dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This hearty blend boasts a dark, inky color, with bright aromas of black fruit, cola, dried rosemary, black olive and spice. The finish is thick, concentrated and long lasting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This round, structured Syrah opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled soil and ground black pepper. The palate shows mature blackberry and raspberry together with notes of spice and clove. Velvety tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas that recall leafy underbrush, grilled porcini and mature dark-skinned fruit. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, coffee, sage and anise alongside tightly wound tannins that give it a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a soft, ripe wine, with juicy acidity to keep it fresh. Flavors of lemon, tangy spice and baked apples are balanced by the taut texture of this still-young wine. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of stewed prune and fig follow through to the evolved palate along with raisin, licorice and a green note of powdered sage. Austere, astringent tannins leave a raspy finish. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of leafy underbrush, grilled porcini, scorched soil and steeped prune lead the nose. The robust, jammy palate offers dried black cherry, espresso, coconut, roasted coffee bean and a confectionary note alongside astringent tannins. Scorching alcohol dominates the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This annual study of Pomerol by the longtime California producer is a bit reserved and nearly austere on the nose, slowly revealing black coffee bean, tar, elderberry and herbs. Crushed herbs and bittersweet chocolate show once sipped, giving slight spice to the dense elderberry and blueberry fruit. It's still a bit wound-up, so drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Raspberry compote, star anise, grilled herb and sun baked earth and a whiff of leather are some of the aromas you'll find on this structured Barolo.

Firm, fine-grained tannins provide structure while a cranberry note gives it a tart finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright berry, rose and baking spice aromas unfold in the glass. The polished palate offers raspberry compote, juicy cherry, licorice, tobacco and chopped herb alongside smooth, velvety tannins. It's already extremely tempting. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Sebastopol Hills neighborhood, relatively cool and wind-affected, this wine has a compelling generosity, a full-bodied concentration that never gets bogged down. The hits of sandalwood, clove and pine provide a sultry edge.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The main issue with this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is a streak of vegetal unripeness that accompanies the cherries and blackberries. The second problem is excessive softness. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, grilled porcini mushroom, leather and a whiff of iris lead the nose. On the youthfully assertive palate, clove, star anise, orange peel and aromatic herb accent tart red cherry while firm tannins and fresh acidity provide the backbone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leafy underbrush, leather, truffle, grilled herb and tilled soil aromas lead the way. The dense, forward palate doles out juicy black cherry, star anise, tobacco and an earthy hint of game while velvety tannins give it a smooth, polished texture. It has immediate appeal and will offer fine drinking for the next few years. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sourced from seven separate vineyard sites, this is a full-bodied, rich and concentrated white, given 15 months in 40% new French oak. The barrel comes through in supportive ways, complementing the freshness of apple and lemon spiked in acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with Nerello Mascalese and a drop of Nerello Cappuccio, this offers earthy aromas suggesting ripe dark-skinned berry, tilled soil, game, truffle and leather. The gamy note follows through to the firm palate, along with mature Marasca cherry, anise and clove. A licorice note wraps up the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a genuine and straightforward red wine from Piedmont that would pair with oven-roasted pasta or meat loaf. The wine (made from Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina) is lean and fresh in the mouth, but ends with a very focused blast of almond and marzipan like flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine that has freshness, some wood and a soft series of tannins, almost velvet. There is a stalky juiciness here, to complete a wine that offers the freshest acidity, with only hints of darker fruits.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wood dominates this wine, the wine itself relatively light, but finely composed. There are spicy tannins with intense acidity, crisp black currants, bursting through the overlay of wood.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A good Cabernet for drinking now, with some extra features of fanciness. It's dry, soft and packs plenty of blackberry and cherry jam flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Chalky tannins and subdued fruit and tannin weight make this an inviting, food-friendly wine, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot. Made from estate vineyards, it's rich in black cherry and dark chocolate, concentrated and layered. It ends in a spicy back note of pepper. Cellar through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Larry Stanton patiently waits to release the wines he grows to very low yields in calcareous soils. The results are rich, in this case offering heavy, intoxicating aromas of kirsch, extracted cherries and a Bourbon-esque caramel element. Smoky tobacco and blackberry juice notes arises on the palate, with fresh laid asphalt flavors popping up on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Merlot, this full-bodied wine opens with aromas of ripe berry, coffee, vanilla, exotic spice and a whiff of grilled herb. The concentrated palate doles out fleshy black cherries, juicy raspberries licorice, chocolate and tobacco, while velvety tannins provide the framework. A note of dried sage closes the finish. It's already approachable but will continue to age well for several years or more. Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas of red and black berry, grilled sage, cedar and tobacco on this vibrant, elegantly structured blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot.

The smooth palate delivers dried black currants, blackberry extract, licorice and cloves wrapped up in velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the many properties in Moulis with Poujeaux in its name, this estate has produced a classic, elegant wine, its Cabernet Sauvignon element providing a delicious black currant flavor, rounded out by the Merlot. Firm tannins still point the wine in the direction of aging, so give it four years and more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: On its own, this Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre-based Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne-style blend is fairly straightforward. It has candied aromas and tastes, suggesting raspberry-flavored licorice and cola. However, it is dry and crisp in acidity, balanced overall. It will be a fine companion to a wide range of fare.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: What a disappointment. This isn't the Artist Series it used to be. It's okay for an everyday Cab, but is simple, with watered-down blackberry and cherry jam flavors. Not ageable, so drink up.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is the personal project of Robert Mondavi's longtime winemaker, Genevieve Janssens, and her husband, Luc. Production is only 250 cases. The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out. My only criticism, and it's a big one, is excessive ripeness that makes it Port-like. The alcohol is 15.5%.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Solalto is a pretty dessert wine with a dark amber color and simple aromas of toasted almond, apricot honey, pine nut and maple syrup. The texture is thick and gritty in places and the wine delivers genuine and easygoing appeal.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This powerful wine reveals its style and breeding from the start. It has weight and concentration allied to great tangy fruit flavors. The nervy edge is very evident, with wood, structure from green apple skins and aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: If you love the biggest and boldest of Barolos, this beautiful wine is for you. It puts forth power and determination with confidence thanks to its aromas of barbecue spice, mesquite, roasted espresso bean, vanilla and ripe red cherry. Give it five more years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This beautiful expression of Nebbiolo from the Cannubi cru opens with elegant and defined aromas of forest fruit, white chocolate, drying minerals, violets and moderate, spicy barbecue-like aromas. The wine shows excellent structure and tight, drying tannins that need 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 more years of cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful wine that needs to age, this Basarin cru selection shows thick layers of berry fruit, cedar wood, almond and dark licorice. The oak element is strong, but the wine is still young and all its many elements will surely come into focus in 10 years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hugely delicious, just a joy to drink. So soft and velvety, so rich in blackberry jam, cassis and chocolate flavors, with the tannins so smooth and round. Really wonderful over the next few years, although the softness and high alcohol suggest it's not an ager.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Ravera cru is celebrated for its power and elegance and this beautiful Barolo definitely delivers both.

The tannins are big, firm and lend a sturdy, powerful feel in the mouth that will become silkier and even smoother with time.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: For a Volnay, this is a very structured wine. It has huge richness laced with firm tannins and dark fruits. It is the firmness that dominates, suggesting some extra extraction, although the acidity does push right through to the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the celebrated Ravera cru, Elvio Cogno delivers a classic and elegant expression of Nebbiolo with tight tannins, long aging potential and nuanced aromas of small berry fruit, cola, leather, licorice and smoky cedar tones.

In the mouth, it boasts thick tannins and excellent length.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Girolamo is a Merlot from the southern part of Chianti Classico that does a remarkable job of being modern and delicate at the same time. On the one hand, you get rich notes of chocolate, cherry and coffee, but on the other, you get ethereal nuances of blueberry, spice and cola. Ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab. Give it until after 2008, if you can keep your hands off, and will come into its own after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lamaione is Frescobaldi's flagship Merlot and this vintage is especially plush and velvety. The wine's nose recalls inky berry juice, exotic spice and soft tones of leather and tobacco. The finish is long and satisfying, supported by the wine's dense structure.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Suolo is a beautiful accomplishment and one of the most pleasing and delicate expressions of Sangiovese to be found. What's so outstanding about this wine is its balanced elegance. Aromas include intense red cherry, light chocolate shavings and vanilla bean. This wine boasts a modern, international persona that translates into supple smoothness and a soft, velvety mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Complex and showing so much of what we love about Ribera del Duero. Baking spices, mature fruit and leather grace the stately bouquet, while the palate sings a pretty tune of berries, plum and brown sugar. There's thrust and potency to the mouthfeel but also a toasty, rich, mocha character. Drinking good now but should hold in there for another five to eight years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thick in extraction, Nearco is a ripe and meaty red with thick layers of blueberry, blackberry, coffee, tobacco, ink, vanilla, spice and cigar box that peel off one solid layer after the other. Nothing is understated here and the wine hits the palate with determined tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Kudos to Azalea Springs for bottling this with a screwtop. The vineyard is between St. Helena and Calistoga, at the foot of Diamond Mountain. It has mountain-sized tannins, making it astringently hard. It also has a solid core of blackberry and black currant fruit. This is not one of your soft, gentle cult Cabs, it's one that demands cellaring. Best 2010\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard, long a source for Beringer's Cabs, is in the north-central valley, east of the Silverado Trail, just below Howell Mountain. It shows the hard, tough tannins of Cabs from that neck of the woods. Flavors of red currants, cherries and cocoa are rich and vibrant, but the wine is too astringent to open now. Hold until after 2010, and it should develop for an additional 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a blockbuster, biodynamic blend of Merlot, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Syrah, Mouv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, Petit Verdot and Grenache. Together, these varieties create a dark, brooding wine with notes of mature black fruit, raisins, leather, spice and beautiful intensity. It's a chewy, rich wine with creamy glycerin in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nardo is a big wine that boasts a New World style and an emphasis on oak aging. Penetrating aromas of black cherry, forest berry, chocolate and spice make a strong statement. There's a nice quality to the tannins and the wine's drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Toreador bottling represents the best Zin winemaker Eric Cinnamon can make from the vineyard. So far, it's been a complex, ageworthy wine, and the '05 continues that tradition. Despite high alcohol, the wine is balanced, with firm tannins framing flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, pomegranates, red currants, leather, dark chocolate, briary nettles and smoke. It will happily take a decade of bottle age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gritty like fruit leather, with a perceived sweetness of plum candy and red licorice, this wine is wide and expansive on the palate, with grippy, persistent tannins. The oak is dominant and pushy on the palate, unsettled somewhat in its integration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from young vines, this is a soft and fruity wine. Wood aging has added richness to the yellow fruits and balancing apple acidity. It's perfumed, opening out with ripe apricot and white peach flavors at the end.

Dried plum skin, cherry and elderberry flavors show on the palate, which is layered with tannins and turns savory with charred beef, charcoal and tobacco flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, toast and black spice aromas lead the nose, accented by whiffs of espresso. The palate offers licorice, clove, dried cherry and vanilla notes, while a backbone of fine-grained tannins provides support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a site near Annapolis, this wine shows a preponderance of dark grape and cherry flavor interwoven with cinnamon and black peppercorn. Light-bodied and ethereally layered, it has touches of rustic earthiness and leather.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The first aromas that emerge from this blend of Bordeaux varieties with a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cCalifornia twist\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d are dried chaparral herb, espresso, black currant and pepper. Cocoa flavors are prominent on the palate, with tangy cranberry, pomegranate and richer dried black cherry fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with subdued, earthy aromas suggesting used leather, grilled sage, Mediterranean scrub and mature berry. On the hearty, monolithic palate, a pronounced licorice note and alcoholic warmth underscore the mature black cherry and clove flavors. Assertive tannins provide a tight framework.

The concentrated, savory palate delivers black currant, white pepper and soothing licorice flavors and fine tannins. Enjoy through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heavy prune and raisin aromas are perfumed and rich, but arguably a bit overripe. Matching the nose, this feels thick, saturated and grapy. Flavors of black plum and blueberry finish chunky, with muscularity but also a rubbery flavor note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black cherry and cassis aromas are bold but basic. This feels fiercely tannic and astringent. Meaty flavors of cherry and black plum end with dried berry notes, prune and rock-hard tannic bite. Give this more time if possible, but like many 2013s it might never soften and improve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers aromas of scorched earth, underbrush and a whiff of oak. The firm palate offers sour cherry, fleshy strawberry, toast, coconut and espresso alongside assertive, close-grained tannins that leave a mouth-drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is smoky, ripe and packed with tannins.

The palate is a bit closed but offers dried cherry, prune, licorice and espresso alongside firm but fleeting tannins. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's evolving quickly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toasted oak, espresso and red berry aromas lead the nose. The palate delivers roasted coffee bean, toast and black pepper but not a lot of fruit richness. Astringent wood tannins give a mouth-drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's rubbery latex, briary plum and berry aromas are potent. Its plum, berry and vanilla flavors finish with shrill acidity, hard, choppy tannins and long-lasting dark berry notes. Drink through 2028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this approachable, accessible and well-made wine is juicy with black fruit and smoky with integrated oak and tannin. Its powerful flavor and robust body ease up on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From winemaker Heidi Barrett's own brand, this Cab is tightly wound in cranberry and tart cherry, before evolving in the glass into a textured, layered experience of toasty oak and a lush, silkiness on the palate. It finishes with a touch of cedar, and should cellar well, through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The partnership between vintner Bill Price and winemaker Gavin Chanin, Lutum continues to impress, aiming for elegance without giving up flavor or body. Tightly wound, a signature perhaps of the vintage, this wine is still subtle, suggesting rhubarb and cherry atop forest floor. Smooth, it hides elusive power on the significant finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red berry, rose and cake spices lead the way on this ripe, forward Barolo. The round palate offers black cherry, raspberry, licorice and white pepper alongside polished tannins. It's already extremely accessible, so don't leave it in the cellar for too long.

The finish has elements of both sweetness and sourness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dry and classy, this is tart in acidity, with an earthiness to the cherry-berry fruit. This is elegant rather than opulent; drink it over the next 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has searing acidity and strong, upfront red-berry and oak flavors. It feels rustictic, but it could be a Cinderella in the making, just waiting to evolve into a princess. If you're a gambler, give it a couple of years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is concentrated, rich, full of blackberry fruits and layered with just the right balance of tannins. Chocolate and sweet fruits are given point by toast and an edge of spice.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The best of CVNE's impressive lineup of 2010 high-end Riojas is this pure, staunch, ripe stud that's blasting with blackberry, woodspice, leather and cedar aromas.

The time in bottle has added complexity and sophistication, making the wine enjoyable now or for several more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Always released after a further year's aging, this rich and full-bodied wine is now at its peak.

Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This beautifully perfumed wine offers an appealing combination of red berry fruits, fragrant acidity and a firmer, dry background. The wine is already deliciously juicy and fruity, although its dry tannins and concentration promise further aging.

Old vines give concentration while also allowing for great freshness. It needs to age further. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Exotic in coconut macaroon on the nose, this wine offers appealing lushness and richness, and is decidedly soft and alluring in red plum and cherry. Medium in weight with plenty of substance, it offers a lift of acidity on the long, peppery finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sophisticated, with tertiary aromas of crushed mineral, asphalt, cola, dried mint, wild berry and cassis. On the palate, it's tight, compact and linear, with a long, polished finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Shows a pretty, polished nose with dusty mineral notes backed by elegant tones of dried berry, spice and leather. Nice complexity and balance. Loads of tobacco-like sensations on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sharply defined aromas of spice, chiseled mineral, dried tobacco and cassis open the bouquet of this dark, concentrated wine. There's a floral note of spicy potpourri and cinnamon stick, tight tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty ensemble of bright fruit, spice and cured meat, with ample concentration. Plump and round in the mouth, with loads of aromatic intensity. The mouthfeel is tight and chiseled.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While the wine does have richness, it's the mineral and citrus side that is coming through at this stage. The balance with the wood aging is so right that you feel the toast rather than tasting it. As it matures, the wine will deepen in intensity and power, certainly over the next 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opens with a dry, dusty firmness that comes through both on the nose and in the mouth. This is fresh and tightly woven with very fine aromas of cassis, spice, crushed stone and milled white pepper. Very firm and tight; age 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This riserva opens with a textured, granular mouthfeel that is packed tight with leather, tobacco, dried berry and cola flavors. The close is fresh and menthol-driven.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright, textbook, loads of Sangiovese intensity with complexity and tight aromas of wild berry, blueberry, almond, white pepper, spice and rum cake. Tight and streamlined in the mouth. Needs more time to soften with cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the most expensive Pinot Noir from Gundlach Bundschu in many years, maybe ever, but it's also easily their best. It's absolutely delicious in cherries, pomegranates and spices, with a wonderful earthiness that grounds it. So silky and complex, so rewarding to drink now. Great to see this veteran winery coming out with a wine this fine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: More spice than ripe fruit characteristics here. There's a dark, savory note of smoked ham or bacon as well, with back-end notes of cola and root beer. Warm, wintery personality. Streamlined and polished in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard north of St. Helena comes this 100% varietal wine. If you like your Cabs soft, superextracted and direct, you'll love it. The blackberry and cherry flavors are so ripe and sweet, they taste like pie filling. Best now and for a couple years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing the richness of the vineyard, this delivers huge, flamboyant flavors of apricot and tangerine jam. While it's technically dry, there's a honeyed sweetness that suggests a touch of botrytis. It's a strong wine, unafraid to command a boldness that may not be for everyone. This is distinctly Californian in style, and as it loses fruit with age, it will develop nut and earthy notes.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This creamy Tuscan Chardonnay shares many characteristics with its distant cousin in California. It shows a decidedly New World style, with aromas of vanilla cream, dried apricot, honey, peach cobbler and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9e.

It exudes richness and power, generous while also firm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is initially austere, but then shows rich, ripe fruit and a solid structure. The wine's strong tannic character suggests considerable aging potential, while it already shows a deliciously gentle side.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From young vines in Chambertin, this is big and generous, showing the richness of the year as well as its depth of fruit. Firm tannins help to give the wine shape.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Barolo Bricco Rocca boasts its own personality that puts more focus on broader, horizontal aromas of Graham cracker, dried grass and spice rather than vertical notes of cola and mint. Because of its unique traits, this wine would pair with stewed meats or baked white beans.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From far-away 2003, this elegant Barolo shows a beautiful evolution in the glass. The wine warms up with pressed rose petal and dried raspberry aromas and segues to cedar, cola, mineral and light shadings of spice. A bright close and acidic note hold the hot vintage very nicely. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wonderful vintage of Tortoniano (a blend of Nebbiolo grapes from the best vineyard crus) opens with amazing intensity and purity of its varietal aromas. The wood element, in the form of toasted almond and espresso bean, is integrated and the close is persistent, smooth and firm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a steady portfolio of above 90-point wines, you can count on Moccagatta for elegant, territory-driven expressions of Nebbiolo. Bric Balin Barbaresco is a beautiful wine with seamless integration of berry, smoke and spice flavors.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Prunotto's wines are easily available in the United States and make a perfect option for those of us who just can't get enough of the Nebbiolo grape. This elegant wine opens with tones of pressed violet, cola, natural rubber and menthol. The wine shows a healthy, vibrant feel with tannins that could use five more years of aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark power and concentration mark the bouquet of this vineyard-designate Barolo Riserva. Sweet oak tones of spice and clove mingle effortlessly with aromas of mature fruit, leather and black truffle. Firm structure and tight tannins give the wine a clean, polished feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep dark berry aromas come with notes of vanilla, gritty spice and tobacco. Hard tannins require cushion and this has just enough to handle things. Blackberry, cassis, barrel spice and molasses flavors finish with savory oak notes, chocolate and lingering blackberry fruit. Drink through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sourced from the producer's Stanly Ranch Estate Vineyard and Hyde Vineyard, both in Carneros, this is a stunning effort. Its baked pear fruit provides hefty body and texture, while honeysuckle and apple blossom notes and a squeeze of lemon-like acidity keep it balanced and fresh.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This modern-style Tempranillo is registering at max ripeness. Aromas of black fruits, raisin, tire rubber and toasty French oak project a dark outlook. In the mouth, this is tight and gripping. Flavors of blackened oak, cassis and blackberry finish firm and closed, with manageable tannins. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry, plum, chocolate and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this structured wine. The palate offers roasted coffee bean, licorice, raisin and black pepper alongside tightly packed tannins that need time to unwind but for now leave an astringent, drying finish. You'll also detect the heat of alcohol on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero offers aromas of white flower, beeswax, toasted almond and a yeasty note of bread crust. The palate displays mature golden apple peel, citrus zest, walnut and candied ginger alongside a soft mousse. It finishes on a note of bitter walnut.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured wine also has already delicious red fruit flavors. The core of tannins is surrounded by this cushion of ripe fruits, layered with acidity and altogether enticing now. Drink now, although the wine will certainly age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forceful and fully oaked, with dark, rubbery, minty black fruit flavors. The palate is a bit rugged but solid as granite. Tastes toasty and roasted, with black fruit and licorice flavors front and center. Rolls along well on the finish, showing lemon zest and clove notes. Drink now through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Not too loud or vocal on the nose; it offers basic but entirely attractive ripe berry aromas. Tastes like blackberry and black cherry, with ample oak adding chocolate and vanilla flavors. Baked and rich tasting but it dries out well on the finish. 375 cases made; drink now through 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep and dark, with cola, blackberry and mossy aromas. This is full-bodied, tight and tannic, with hardness that will only be tempered by food and/or more time in bottle. Tastes bold, chunky and ripe, with chocolate and licorice along with heat and tannic fire. Drink now through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the most expensive newly released Cherryblock ever, $20 more than the 2007. It's quite a plush wine, softly velvety and rich in cherry and oak flavors. Already throwing considerable sediment, it's on the glidepath to a long, useful life.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Given the difficulties of the 2010 vintage, this wine is a success. The tannins are young, thick and astringent, and then the acids kick in. After that initial assault, the palate begins to get more interesting complexities of black currants, blueberries, minerals and oak. The suggestion is ageability, but only limited. Give it until 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932017 years and drink with hearty fare.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It opens with aromas of sun-ripened berries, spearmint and Mediterranean scrub.

It's ripe, soft and ready to enjoy soon.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From a small, single-vineyard plot of 3.5 acres, this shows intense fruit, very aromatic in character. Its concentration is immense, dark black fruits vying with spice, tar and sweet plum pudding flavors. The Cabernet Franc shows through well here, giving a perfumed finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: As a contrast to Jonathan Maltus's Le Carr\\u00c3\\u00a9, this single-vineyard wine, from vines situated only 100 yards away, has a taut, mineral flavor, with an initial austere character which then opens out to give dark bitter chocolate and plum skin flavors. It is potentially a richer, more impressive wine, but it needs aging for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This brawny wine opens with aromas that recall resin, nail polish remover, prune and nutmeg. The warm, monolithic palate offers dried black fruit steeped in spirits, raisin and licorice alongside assertive tannins. The burn of evident alcohol and lack of fruit richness throws it off balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Modern and bulky, this has a lot of great things going on. It opens with aromas of mineral, graphite, sage and bold berry, with chewy, roasted black-fruit flavors. It's long, compact, chocolaty and spicy on the finish. Still not mature but it's drinkable\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094best from 2014 and on.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Flashy and delicious, this just blows your mind. It's like the essence of the ripest, purest blackberries, with a note of cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis and the sweet appeal of melted dark chocolate. It's a soft wine, but grippy in tannins, which gives it good structure. Your best bet may be to drink it over the next six years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is by far the most expensive of Duckhorn's new releases, but it's not the best to drink now. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's easy to imagine the winemaker singling out the most tannic and concentrated lots, but what you get is, simply, a very tannic wine. There's a gigantic core of blackberry and black currant fruit, but it's hard to appreciate because of the astringency. The suggestion is longterm aging, but there can be no guarantees.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a serious Toro wine with smooth, dark, leathery aromas along with hints of wintergreen, licorice and berry pastry. It feels rich and layered, with complex flavors of licorice gum drop, nutmeg, chocolate and blackberry. Almost decadent but not over the top or too tannic. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Roccato is a blend of 50% Sangiovese and 50% Cabernet Sauvignon that's packed with aromas of blackberry, leather, tobacco and chocolate. It's velvety and rich, with a delicious touch of cherry and cinnamon on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A cheerful super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this shows a very elegant and sophisticated side. It is modern, plump and extracted, but it also delivers fine aromas of cherry, vanilla, spice and pipe tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dry, rich and intricate, this is clearly capable of aging. The tannins are still pretty fierce, and buried under them is a dense core of blackberry and currant fruit\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a testament to the near-perfect vintage conditions. The Bordeaux-style blend is mainly based on Cabernet Sauvignon. Give it until 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Pratt Vineyard on Sexton Road, this impressive offering is bold and lush, smoothly textured even in its concentration of thick red cherry and forest.

The currant aroma carries over to the austere palate along with cranberry, chopped herb and French oak. With its backbone of firm acidity and assertive close-grained tannins, it already boasts finesse but will need years to soften and develop. Drink 2021\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Merlot, this offers subtle aromas of plum, French oak, menthol and a whiff of chopped herb.

A creaminess on the palate is lush and round yet able to find companionship in a wealth of juicy acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full bodied and fully concentrated, this estate-grown wine showcases black tar, licorice and black cherry, well-developed flavors that ride a luxurious texture of grippy tannin and toasty oak. Dark as night, the flavors are protracted and extensive through the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very fine and high-toned, a Cabernet that shows real class and pedigree. Entirely drinkable now for its soft, lush tannins and elaborately detailed blackberry, black cherry, anise, carob and cedar flavors that last long through a spicy finish. Should age well through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nice, brawny and integrated, with sexy aromas of wild berry, dark plum, leather and earth. The palate has the right weight and tannic grab, while the flavors of black fruit, fine herbs, cola and coffee are measured yet generous. Finishes with driving chocolate and vanilla flavors. Drink now through 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing the usual balance and harmony of this bottling, which is made from the five Bordeaux varieties, the '06 nonetheless lacks a bit of the richness of other vintages. It's beautifully clean and dry, with sound currant, blackberry, herb tea and cedar flavors, but is missing a certain fatness in the middle.

The intense, off-dry palate of pistachio, pecan and apricot lead to a long, minerally finish. Carries its hefty 15.5% alcohol well. Best now to 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With Pinot Noir, texture is everything, and this lovely wine is pure silk and satin. That makes it drinkable now, with its pretty flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola, cinnamon butter and sandalwood. But it's also tannicly tough, with a sandpapery scour. Seems like it should mellow over the next 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years, although not much beyond that.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum.

Drink it from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from 65-year-old vines, this is a rich and perfumed wine from the estate of Nicolas Potel. It is structured, balancing the red fruits and acidity with a solid framework of tannins.

It does have some concentration and red-berry fruits, although the structure and the tannins are still firm. The wine should age further to allow the fruit to mature and shine. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: In the prestigious village of Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e, there is little room for anything but Grand and Premier Cru vineyards.

The syrupy concentrated palate doles out raspberry jam, stewed prune, anise and nutmeg framed in big chewy tannins. A confectionery note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a beautiful botrytised wine, made from a field blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Gew\\u00c3\\u00bcrztraminer. Light on its feet and reined-in in terms of sweetness, it's golden hay-colored and has a touch of reduction, allowing the Riesling nose to dominate. Decadent yet restrained, it's also lengthy and complex, with highlights of orange and pear.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromatically, this wine is currently subdued, with the notes of raspberry, cocoa and cherry that haven't fully blossomed.

Dazzles now for sheer decadence, but so rich, it's hard to tell where it's going.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of zingy acidity in this Pinot, but also lots of fruit. Explodes in sunny California raspberries, cherries, blackberries and pomegranates, with a rich coating of sweet oak. Drink this flashy wine now and through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: New oak dominates this wine, giving it aromas of toast and vanilla. After decanting, the air brings out interesting notes of dried herbs and blackberries. Tastes very rich and flamboyant, almost sweet, like a chocolate berry pastry, and should develop over the next few years. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with Sangiovese, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A sweet wine, but lively, touched by honey, its acidity coming through as delicious final fruit and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has been an interesting wine from Niner. Last year's bottling was terrific. So's this 2006. At the ripe old age of five, it's still firm in tannins and even has a cut of acidity that gives the blackberry and blueberry fruit a bite. Tastes fresh and lively, and could improve with 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Funky aromas of game, truffle and a faint whiff of barnyard carry over to the medium-bodied palate along with black cherry jam, cinnamon and a hint of vanilla.

It doesn't quite all come together but delivers plenty of intrigue, showing a fine sense of elegance.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: New oak, chopped herb, dark spice and menthol aromas lead the nose. The tense linear palate offers raspberry, dried sour cherry, star anise and a minty note alongside bracing close-grained tannins that grip the finish. Give the tannins time to unwind. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in a drier, more elegant style than many other Napa Cabs, this polished bottling can be described as Bordeaux-esque. Its blackberry and currant flavors are grounded in a cedary structure of earth and herbs. Great for a wine list. Drink this fine wine now and through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a beautiful wine in this Cabernet blend, which was grown at the foot of Howell Mountain. But it's not showing its best now. Just too tannic, and the fruity flavors are all primary and unintegrated with the new oak barrels. With a wealth of raspberries, cherries and currants, it should begin to come into its own after 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a standout Barbera from Monferrato with loads of intensity, complexity and persistency. You'll get aromas of blackberry and cherry followed by exotic spice, vanilla and pipe tobacco. The mouthfeel is smooth, soft and thick. Excellent.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opens with oak, coconut, toast and camphor aromas while the tightly wound palate offers Marasca cherry, espresso, mocha and star anise flavors.

Drink after 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A handful of vineyards and additions of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot make up the whole of this wine, a cool-climate style accented in spicy red currant, cherry and woody tannin. With an earthiness of compost and wood, it shows a touch of reduction as it finishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While this wine is firm, with some fine tannins, it also has a pure line in fresh strawberry fruits that will develop as the tannins soften. This perfumed wine will develop slowly. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: For aged Ribera del Duero, this is right on target. An elegant, lightly leafy nose with lemony oak and tobacco notes along with dried berry and plum aromas is spot on and classy. The palate feels plump and honest, with moderate tannins. Flavors of earthy plum and berry, tobacco and a pantry's worth of spice finish full and chunky. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the southern part of Nuits-Saint-Georges, this small premier cru has produced a dark and structured wine with plenty of dry tannins that need to age. It is concentrated and firm, the tannins backed up by generous black-plum fruits. Drink this wine from 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While this wine has generous swathes of ripe fruit, it also has plenty of the dark tannins that are found in the northern part of the appellation.

Drink this impressive wine from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subdued aromas of spirits, raisin, menthol and resin emerge on this. The bulky palate shows blistering alcohol and a hint of raisin but it lacks fruit richness. Grainy tannins leave a raspy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sharp and herbal, this new Rediviva has a high-acid, peppery profile. It penetrates deeply into the palate, with excellent length. The herbal side of both the Syrah and the Cabernet is what is most forcefully expressed.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Chardonnay offers nothing but deliciousness, and doesn't apologize for any lack of subtlety. It's as rich as a dessert pastry, with pineapple and orange pie, buttered croissant and vanilla flavors. Brisk acidity makes it all shiny and bright. It's arguably one of the best Napa Valley Chardonnays out there.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from fruit grown in the Hudson Vineyard on the Napa side of Carneros, this Chardonnay is rich, creamy and soft. There's a touch of dried herbs to the orange, banana-cream pie and butterscotch.

It aims for a bright, restrained and complex style, which it achieves here with aplomb. Black cherry, mint and a tease of smoky oak accent a fleshy, lengthy texture and body that shines in acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Maple-tinged oak aromas are huge and frame equally massive black-fruit scents. A tight clampy palate needs time to soften and expand; it's hard and unyielding now. Flavors of black fruits, coffee, chocolate and heavy oak finish firm and peppery, with a reprise of grabby, grating tannins. Drink from 2020 through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The producer veers off its estate program to tap into the beauty and brawn that is Kanzler, a magnificent site of its own. Raspberry and a touch of vanilla swirl around a darkness of allspice and cola, lifted by bold acidity and a wealth of texture. Full bodied, this wine shows plenty of oak that should become more integrated in time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a lovely wine, softly integrated and lean in muscle strength, with enviable complexity and length. Cedar, cranberry and currant are all represented, along a dusting of dried herbs and blackberry pie. This ripe, full-bodied wine never slips through the cracks, maintaining itself with grace under pressure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There is just a hint of the structure normally associated with the appellation. Otherwise, the wine is broad and soft with rounded berry and cherry flavors. It comes from vines on the flatter vineyards in the valley. It's a wine that will mature quickly. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon (85%) takes the lead on this blend, with the balance Syrah.

Dusty tannin and a weight of leather saddle permeate the nose and palate, with graphite puncturing through the soft texture and finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lifted peach and wilting petals of Damask rose unite in the perfumed, supremely aromatic nose of this wine. The palate continues with rosewater notes of Turkish Delight and candied peach. Honeyed and rich, the sweet palate is concentrated but guided by lemony freshness. Overwhelming with perfume and concentration, this decadent wine needs either a perfumed, peachy dessert or a salty blue cheese to match those crashing waves of full-blown flavor.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Elegant and complex, this gorgeous wine is all about finesse, offering enticing aromas of rose petal, iris, perfumed berry, baking spices, anise and chopped aromatic herbs. The structured but silky palate seamlessly melds together juicy Morello cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, clove, licorice and tobacco while bright acidity and ultrafine tannins provide the framework.

A balance of acidity and brightness lurks beneath the weight, rounded by succulent blackberry and black cherry. Cellar through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine stops you in your tracks with its aromas of earth, peat, fire pit, tapenade and coffee.

It's a knockout.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A deep color and aromas of toasted baguette, wood smoke and black cherry signal a classic style.

The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This big, young Pinot should have been held back before release, because it's really tannic and primary now, making its future hard to evaluate. However, it seems a likely cellar candidate.

Its apricot jelly and dried fruit flavors, acidity and botrytis are in perfect balance, developing intensity as it opens. A full, generous wine with a great future. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This impressive wine has great intensity and superb apricot and orange flavors. Acidity mingles with its botrytis core and rich, concentrated fruit, striking a fine balance. It will become delicious as it matures. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's another stunning offering from this fantastic estate. Elegant, structured and restrained, it opens with enticing Nebbiolo scents of blue flower, perfumed berry, dark spice and a light balsamic note of eucalyptus. The luminous palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry, licorice and cinnamon while vibrant acidity and firm, polished tannins provide seamless support. Drink 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932043.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine has great richness. Along with its spice and honey notes, there are orange and lemon fruit flavors that give it lift. Beautifully balanced and ripe, it has the potential to be a superb wine. The botrytis core is what gives it its great aging potential. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature iris, blackberry, tobacco, crushed mint and baking spice lift out of the glass on this gorgeous Barolo. Despite the scorching heat, the Scavino made a supremely elegant wine, boasting black cherry, crushed black raspberry, menthol, star anise and ground clove framed in fine-grained, velvety tannins and fresh acidity. A gorgeous wine. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932031.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense and ripe, this is a superb wine from a top Sauternes estate. It has all the expected elements, including concentrated botrytis and honeyed flavors. Seville orange and lemon notes provide contrast, as does its acidity, which is just as intense as the honey character. It will age well, so drink from 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens makes this wine, a small-production solo project that's worth seeking. The 83% Cabernet Sauvignon is sourced from Hendry Ranch and the 17% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, a stone's throw from To Kalon. Impressively concentrated and lengthy, within a wealth of power, it is nuanced in black cherry, leather saddle and crushed rock, with the scent of violet never far behind.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a show-stopping blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec by veteran winemaker Kevin Willenborg. A deep shade of mauve, the wine coats the glass and unleashes intense, lavish aromas of cassis, fig paste, mint and tarragon. It's as soft as it looks on the palate, where baked black cherry, roast beef, turned earth and lilac flavors ride luxurious yet firmly structured tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This marks the debut of consulting winemaker Matthew Courtney's take on the estate site. It dazzles in complex notes of exotic Asian spice, lavender and crushed rock, while focused acidity provides a context of substance and depth.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Purple flower, perfumed berry, baking spice and dried herb aromas unfold in the glass, along with a hint of espresso. The tight palate shows sour cherry, unripe strawberry, clove, sage and roasted coffee notes alongside close-grained, astringent tannins and racy acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fleshy, dense and bright with cassis and vanilla notes, this 100% varietal estate wine is lovely and elegantly restrained, showing compact oak and firm tannin. Raspberry, tobacco and cedar round out the nuanced flavors that open over time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full-throttle oak, vanilla, tobacco and smoky blackberry aromas feed into a full, grippy but surprisingly fresh palate. Toasty oak, blackberry and spice flavors finish long and steady. Drink this excellent Tempranillo from a powerful vintage through 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dominated by its toasty wood flavors, this is a wine still under development. It has weight, the fruit offering great potential richness. Spice, lime fruits and a firm, steely core all promise to come together into a fine wine in five years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A glamorous wine, rich and complex, with lots going on. Lacks perhaps some of the depth of, say, the '03 and '04, more on a par with the 2007, but still a very fine Insignia. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors wrapped into thick tannins and fine new oak sweetness, it's nowhere ready to drink now. Give it a rest until 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its initial toast flavors, this is a wine that is made for aging. It has weight and opulence to go with the structure and sweet fruits. The peaches combine with citrus in a delicious counterpoint to the structure. Age for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fruit is the hallmark of this blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon but with one-third Merlot. It's flamboyant in blackberries and cherries, so ripe and pure, while oak adds an equal measure of sweet toast and smoke. With firm, ripe tannins, this wine needs time in the cellar. Should begin to come into its own after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Extraordinarily concentrated in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. So strongly sweet in fruit and oak, it's almost undrinkable now, tasting like a melted dessert tart. Yet the minerality, tannins and overall structural integrity strongly suggest ageability. Cellar this young wine until at least 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very mineral textured wine, speaking of limestone soil. It balances a toasty, smoky character against the ripest green and yellow fruits. The citrus lends its acidity to tighten up a finely structured, ageworthy wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A perfumed wine that smells and tastes mature. While it still has some sweet strawberry fruit, secondary flavors of coffee, toast and mature acidity dominate. It is not likely to improve much with further keeping, but is a delectable Pinot Noir now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While having the richness of the vintage, this wine also has all the steely minerality of Chablis. Its acidity goes in a crisp line from the yellow and white fruits to the wood. Still young, give the wine another 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years. Screwcap.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rich and flashy, from the get-go. It's dry and smooth, with fierce tannins giving a hit of astringency to the ripe, oaky black currant and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis flavors. Give it five years in the cellar to start to mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rather lifted nose of peach and blossom creates a heady opening. There also is the merest hint of vanilla. The palate reprises these notes with creamy vanilla, ripe peach and honeysuckle. Warmth is palpable on this rather luscious, incredibly generous and still-evolving wine. The finish is beautifully corralled into zesty sweetness by ripe lemon. This is layered and complex and must be savored slowly. It will continue to develop. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a 25-acre site on the western flank of Rutherford, this wine includes 2% Malbec. With sanguine cassis, cranberry and cinnamon touches, it's a soft, round and velvety expression of the hearty variety, finishing with notes of coffee and dark chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A touch of earth and the purest expression possible of tart ripe red apple immediately draws you in on the nose. The absolutely dry palate also has a touch of that earthiness and adds more apple-peel notions to the fruit while a vivid lemon brightness takes center stage. This is generous and earthy in a typically Alsatian idiom but then that freshness kicks in and takes this to another level. It channels and guides all the energy and power of this site into alluring dynamics on the palate. The finish is dry, long and lovely. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe notions of juicy peach and yellow pear rise from the glass. Around the edges they have an aromatic touch of grapefruit zest. That zesty notion remains a constant fixture on the very rich medium-sweet palate, countering the luscious richness of the fruit which shines with honeyed peach, juicy pear and ripe tangerine. It is the zestiness that frames everything on this rich powerful palate. This is lovely now but it has all the fruit and concentration to age well. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932037.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark, inky and smoky on the nose, this estate-grown Cab is supple and medium bodied, offering bursts of juicy dark plum and berry on the palate. The oak is well-integrated and unobtrusive.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This oak-aged Vermentino is pristine and fresh in style, and the palate offers some heft. Nuances of exotic fruit, lemon zest, apricot and almond cream appear on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has weight and ripe plum and damson flavors that are now integrating into the tannins. It's worth aging for a few years, but it is already enjoyable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied wine demonstrates the jammy side of Volnay. It is rich and dense, and it has a delicious berry flavor. In the process of all this generosity, the tannins are lost, so drink it over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak, toast, espresso and stewed prune carry over to the palate together with a note of dark cooking spice. Assertive, close-grained tannins give this an astringent finish. Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then drink up to enjoy the remaining fruit. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sanguine and velvety, this richly derived wine made from one clone of Pinot Noir is tannic in black cherry, cinnamon and tar, with a lean, mid-length finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toast, oak and a whiff of coffee. The palate is still rather closed but eventually reveals raw cherry, anise, clove and ground pepper accompanied by bracing tannins and racy acidity. A note of dried sage closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mature plum, cake spices, baked earth, leather and a balsamic note all come together on this full-bodied, single-vineyard offering. The forward, savory palate delivers mature black cherry, clove and licorice alongside ripe, assertive tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, tobacco, baked earth and a whiff of pressed rose float from the glass. The round, full-bodied palate delivers dried berry, licorice and clove alongside ripe tannins. It's balanced but it also shows the heat of the vintage and is already almost accessible. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This offers pretty aromas of perfumed dark berry, cake spice, leather, toast and a balsamic note. The full-bodied palate offers young red cherry, mint, oak, espresso and sage. Firm but velvety tannins and bright acidity provide the framework while a mocha note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of dark berry, violet, mint and menthol lead the nose and carry over to the palate together with juicy cherry and a note of baking spice. This is still tightly wound with densely packed but refined tannins and brisk acidity. Give it time to open up and blossom over the next few years. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Compelling aromas of rose and lavender mark this fairly full-bodied wine, giving it a lift on the nose and palate. Raspberry and black licorice take over the taste, concentrating flavor and intensity toward the lengthy, earthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is winemaker Ross Cobb's own family project, from extremely cool sites along the Sonoma Coast, including the family's own Coastlands vineyard. Here, with Rice-Spivak, he skirts the edge of ripeness, producing a light, bright wine that's at first hard to penetrate. Faint notes of tart cherry and pomegranate weave through like a fog, a seasoning of allspice on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the folks at Merryvale, this is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Syrah and Petite Sirah. Big, dense and juicy, with a dusty tannic underbite, it's bold, brambly and exuberantly delicious.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Seze family has owned this estate since the 18th century, producing in 2009 a finely textured wine, one that has juicy black fruits and an elegant structure. It is a more structured take on the vintage, firm with dry tannins and acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured wine opens with aromas of black fruit, underbrush, mint and spice with an earthy touch of saddle leather. The juicy palate delivers a core of black cherry accented with notes of thyme, sage, espresso and mocha supported by a tannic backbone. It's well balanced, with enough freshness to ensure it will develop complexity over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Structured but poised, it opens with balsamic aromas of menthol, red berries, blue flower, Asian spices and a hint of new leather. The succulent palate offers dark cherry accented with notes of mint, lemon sage and chocolate alongside polished tannins and just enough freshness. It's delicious and already approachable so enjoy soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bold, balanced wine opens with classic Sangiovese aromas of underbrush, dried tobacco leaf, red berries, blue flower and a waft of leather. The juicy palate shows depth, delivering ripe wild cherry accented with white pepper, licorice and a mineral note alongside solid but refined tannins. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This powerful, perfumed wine shows as much structure as fruit. That gives it a strong presence, solid and dense. Its black plum and damson fruits have richness, spice and intense acidity. With the dark tannins, the wine will certainly age. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: For the first time, this release of Buty's Rediviva, from estate vineyards in the Rocks region of Walla Walla, includes a bit of Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre. The pretty fruit flavors of strawberry preserves, blueberry and black cherry carry both a mineral underpinning and a whiff of the barnyard in the nose. The aging in mostly neutral puncheons and barrels adds just a hint of baking spices.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This structured wine opens with aromas that recall underbrush, blue flower, mature black plums, balsam and a whiff of leather. The palate delivers black cherry sweetened with vanilla, toasted oak, espresso and chocolate alongside bracing tannins. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine presents itself full-bodied and big in style, with an inkling of red plum and cherry fighting for attention against a tide of rounded concentration and darker, smokier tinges of cigar and chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This tiny production is marked by strong aromas of barbecue smoke and campfire, before unfurling an unfussy, soft and full-bodied burst of red fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Defines a ripe, slightly alcoholic style of Napa Cab for drinking over the next few years. It's dry and stylishly smooth in tannins, with a nice array of blackberries, currants, cola and sweet cedar wood.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows notes of prune and chocolate, but not much complexity or finesse. It has delicious fruit and an approachable palate, but it's a bit one dimensional.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This soft and gentle wine doesn't show great character. Wood and yellow fruits appear timidly through the rounded texture. Drink now and until 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty floral notes rise to the top: lavender and pressed rose. That intense floral element gives the wine an elegant, sophisticated personality that's tight and structured, with great balance between firm tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark as night, with charcoal, campfire, sweet berry and jammy notes to the alluring bouquet. Lively on the palate, with tangy acidity propelling black fruit, sweet oak, licorice and spice flavors. Solid, well built and generally smooth. Excellent Ribera from a very good year. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opens with a sweet opulent nose driven by aromas of plump cherry, moist pipe tobacco, chocolate fudge, vanilla bean and ground espresso. But the wine is not modern or overtly international in terms of its style. It shows deep roots in Montalcino tradition and a bold, overt personality. Earth, leather and dried tobacco drive the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There is a lot of power in this wine. It has great weight and richness and an intense structure. Hanging from the frame of the wine are dark plum fruits, layers of wood, sweet spice, complex acidity and dry tannins. Age for 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00937 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bold fruit layers of red cherry, plum, blackberry, spice, cola and chocolate mark this wine. The quality of the fruit is still raw and bright and could use several years of cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This gorgeous Brunello is packed tight with personality and intensity. The wine is redolent of candied cherry, blackberry, rum cake, cinnamon bread and dried ginger. It shows steely, firm structure and a tightly knit texture. Compact, sharp and decisive.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Brunello opens with floral notes of pressed red rose and clay soil. Bright fruit, blackberry, leather and tobacco aromas are framed by firm tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky overtones of barbecue and pipe tobacco fill in the background and provide a platform for all the busy cherry and ripe berry notes presented on the nose. It's a big, bold style with loads of savory spice, black pepper and smoked bacon. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very structured, as befits a Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e, even a village wine. The black cherry fruit and layered acidity are combined with a firm and dry tannic core. There is power here, and some aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a nicely perfumed element to the nose that recalls pressed blue flower or lavender potpourri. Bold berry and currant undertones form a base of plumpness and richness. Light shadings of spice and toasted nut drive the mouthfeel. Structured and firm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A lovely wine, soft and charming, but far from simple. Although it has complex layers of cherries, blackberries, cassis and cedar, it also shows a fine structure of ripe, smooth tannins and supporting acidity. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932015 while it's fresh and forward.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Poggio al Vento (from the 2004 vintage) shows smoky and savory notes of forest floor, bramble, cured meat, barbecue spice and teriyaki sauce. The wine is compact in the mouth, with polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This brunello offers a pretty bouquet, showing elegance and restraint at the same time. There are layers of small berry fruit, spice and leather, with dusty, dry tannins. The wine's overall astringency should soften with time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A good, sound wine, but far from a success for the Artist Series. In fact it shows rustic tannins and the slightly sweet softness you might find in, say, a Paso Robles Cab. Disappointing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This tight and energetic wine opens with menthol, new leather, wild berry, blue flower and grilled herb aromas. The focused palate mirrors the nose, offering juicy sour cherry, cranberry, star anise and clove flavors framed by youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This lightly bodied, elegant wine is subtle and crisp\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a study in white pepper and leather that's both complex and tightly layered. Cool climate to its core, it shows floral aromas and flavors of rose petal and lavender as hints of rhubarb and tart cherry make their way onto the quiet palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggesting underbrush, aromatic herb, violet, new leather and earthy game follow through to the chewy, full-bodied palate in this wine, along with ripe black cherry and a hint of baking spice. It's structured and surprisingly accessible, with rounded, velvety tannins. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a single vineyard on flinty silex soil, this is a taut and concentrated wine. Its intensity is enhanced by the tense texture and powerful youthful acidity. At this stage, it is still young, still with its exuberant fruit. So wait to drink this wine until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A big, firm 100% Cab, rich in blackberry jam and black currant flavors, enriched with lots of sweet, smoky oak. It's made in the modern cult style of soft approachability. It might age, but seems best now for sheer luxury.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth in tannins with a nice bite of acidity, this shows rich flavors of blackberry, cherry and spice, with a touch of mocha that gives it an apparent sweetness. It's a Bordeaux blend with some Syrah, grown in the famed Stagecoach Vineyard.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this Merlot is rich, smooth and bone dry. With modest alcohol, it brims with flavors of black and red currant, licorice, anise and white pepper, as well as a subtle touch of sweet, smoky new oak. The grapes come from the cool Soda Canyon area of Napa Valley, at the base of Atlas Peak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Butter, pain grill\\u00c3\\u00a9 and roasted nut aromas expand on the palate into honey, peach and tangerine flavors, accented by citrus and mineral notes. Spicy (white peppery) on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: California comes to Burgundy in this wine, which features aromas of toast, caramel and butterscotch and flavors of buttered baked apples. Lush and obvious; even shows a bit of California-esque heat on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A persistent ripe cheesy aroma is the only thing that mars this Cabernet-based big brother to Belcore. There's ample black fruit to the palate and a full blast of espresso on the smooth finish. It's young now, but already it's opening up. Maybe the funky aromatics will subside with additional bottle age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sassello is an extremely well integrated wine with deep aromas of black cherry, forest berry, chocolate fudge and leather. The wine is sweet, succulent and round in the mouth with a slight alcoholic tug at the very end. Pair it with steak and green pepper cream sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The oak note is still a bit pungent here and the wine needs three or four more years of cellaring before reaching harmony. Beyond that, however, this super Tuscan blend offers a solid base of blackberry, spice, leather and tobacco.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a direct and pungent Brunello with an intense, vertical lift and a steady delivery of fruit, spice and smoke aromas. It opens with dried raspberry, cassis, clove and pipe tobacco followed by fine tannins and persistency.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Argiano's Suolo is a true standout in the world of Tuscan Sangiovese. It achieves elegance, complexity and richness with bright cherry notes contrasted against sweet vanilla and spicy oak. The finish is long, smooth and persistent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fruit-forward wine opens with bursting notes of cherry, blackberry, vanilla, almond paste, cola and delicate touches of resin or wet river stone. It's an impressive achievement that straddles a fine line between modernity and tradition.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brunello is the perfect winter wine to enjoy by a roaring fire with friends or a romantic partner. This expression from Terralsole is particularly well suited to this happy fate thanks to its silky, soft nature, firm tannins, spice aromas and bursting fruit tones.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lombrone Riserva is an earthy, nicely concentrated wine that needs more time to age and integrate. It shows great structure with tight tannins and a long, beautiful finish characterized by cherry and delicate spicy shadings.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Caprili brings us a beautifully elegant and shapely Brunello that is enhanced by plump cherry and wild berry nuances. Subdued tones of vanilla and spice add a nice touch of zest on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The counterpart to Lynn's Blend, named for a co-proprietor, Anisya's showcases the lighter side of the Sonoma Coast in its exuberance of red cherry, orange and strawberry. Textured, it features bright acidity and layers of freshness, teased in black tea and wild truffle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grande is one of the most historic vineyards in southern Napa, still presided over by the lovely Dorothy Rossi, whose father planted the oldest vines here in 1920, the year she was born. The location, farming and age work together to offer aromas of dusty leather satchel and a richness of juicy blackberry and cranberry. Powerfully elegant and integrated, it evolves in the glass in a myriad of ways, surprising with every sip.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Black cherry, cassis and cola aromas are on the money and exact, with nothing overt sticking out. This bottling is strongly built, probably the most tannic of Atauta's 2010 single-vineyard wines, but it's not coarse. Savory flavors of smoked meat, tea and baked berry fruits end with rooty, roasted notes. Drink through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a spicy, fully plush and complete wine, integrated in oak and tannin with a strength of black-cherry compote that gives an extra edge. The length and texture are impressive, showcasing the power of the vineyard in a ripe, even vintage, and some deft winemaking as well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This complex white comes from cuttings procured in 2004 from one of the oldest surviving vineyards of this variety, thought to have originated in the Loire Valley, then replanted by the producer onto older rootstock. Lemony acidity meets light, bright floral intrigue around hints of peach, grapefruit and lime, remaining velvety smooth and balanced.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Warm and ripe, this is a beautifully balanced wine. It is packed with black-currant fruits that are bursting out of the glass. A darker side comes with the tannins and new wood flavors that are still prominent. It looks likely the wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Clear, light color reveals the elegance at the core of this coastal wine. It reigns in ripeness without sacrificing flavor or complexity. Stemmy, earthy overtones meet a vibrantly spicy bite of cherry and white pepper. The silky texture compels one to want more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of licorice, dark berry, dried herb, leather and a balsamic note lead the way. The firm palate offers ripe Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, pipe tobacco and licorice while firm, velvety tannins lend finesse. This won't need years to come around but it also shows staying power. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with Nebbiolo planted in the high vineyards of Valtellina, this vibrant fragrant red opens with aromas of rose, wild berry, Alpine herb and a tarry note.

Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The shy nose offers subdued aromas recalling aromatic herb, underbrush and a balsamic note of camphor. The palate is rather lean, showing dried sour cherry, anise and mint alongside mouth-drying but not very persistent tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Densely packed with black fruit and barrel toast, this wine is mouth-puckering with tannin and power. A lightly perceptible dried herb note weaves through its dark texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Impressively ripe fruit, with smoky flavors from wood, the texture sweet and fleshy. The wine has juicy berry flavors, with the freshest acidity, livened with spice from the fruit and the oak aging. Worth aging for 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine that has richness, with acidity, layers of spice and black currant fruit flavors. The dominant cassis gives elegance, and already a forward balance of fruit and wood.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There is a good core of tannin here, the fruit sweet plums and ripe tannins, relatively soft and easy. Only that kernel of tannin offers some aging possibility.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Almost honeyed in its richness, this is a ripe and rounded wine. A touch of toastiness brings out the apricot and peach flavors along with the rich acidity and soft texture. It's a wine to age, with its fruit and structure still coming into balance. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full-bodied and layered, this is a stellar example of the variety, exhibiting elegance beneath a broader exterior. Black pepper and blackberry wrap around dense tannins and a robust texture. The wine is co-fermented with Viognier to bring a floral note to the bouquet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A full-bodied blend from different vineyard sites, this wine celebrates darker, denser aspects of black cherry and cranberry alongside a savory, herbal component that persists on the palate, finished up by a mouthwatering mix of orange and chocolate. Complex and robust in tannin, it needs time to breathe before being enjoyed.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A majority varietal, this wine also holds small amounts of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Syrah. These combine well with one another to exude notes of licorice, plum and black cherry. Right now, it ends with sprinklings of dried herb. Dense and tannic, it will soften with time, through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous wine that's fat and smooth in nectarines, tangerine, custard and tropical fruits, with a kiss of sweet, smoky oak. The two varieties were co-fermented in this very happy marriage of a wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a huge, complex wine, filled with currant, cocoa and dried herb flavors wrapped into dusty tannins. It's dry, elegant and even ageworthy. The richness is balanced by crisp acidity, like a squirt of lime juice that makes the dark fruit dance.

Calls for equally hefty barbecue, but also has the structure to age interestingly over the next six years, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Extra Brut sparkler offers drying mineral tones backed by passion fruit, kiwi, pear and Golden Delicious apple.

The 2012 fulfills all the basic California requirements for impressive Chardonnay, with ripe, flamboyant tropical fruit, pear and pineapple flavors, along with lots of sweet, buttery, vanilla-accented oak. This is one of the most decadent Chardonnays of the vintage, and while it's a little soft, it is flashy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A hugely concentrated wine, it has a dark feel to it, mineral and structured. It shows spice, suggestions of the wood aging and always the ripest fruit. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is characterized by both structure and rich fruitiness.

It should age for up to 20 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In recent years, Precious Mountain Vineyard has provided Bob Cabral with some of his most glorious fruit. Tremendous in flash and depth, it offers compelling flavors of raspberry and cherry, accented by sweet, smoky oak. There's such complexity in the acid and tannin structure, and in the earthy, stony, spicy nuances, that you find something new to love with every sip. This masterpiece is fabulous now, and will develop bottle complexity over the next 15 years, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another spectacular Dolce, which continues the brand's string of successes and further emphasizes its standing as one of California's greatest- white dessert wines. It lacks a touch of the concentration found in the 2006, but it dazzles nonetheless with intricate, sweet flavors of honey, butterscotch, golden-apricot nectar, orange marmalade, pineapple tart, vanilla and buttered toast. And all that is brightened by crisp acidity. Terrific to drink now, and it will hold in a proper cellar for a decade. The blend is 82% S\\u00c3\\u00a9millon and 18% Sauvignon Blanc.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This squat bottle comes, indeed, straight from the barrel with no filtering, and works quite well.

The tannins are a bit tough, but rugged in the right ways.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a hillside vineyard near Moon Mountain overlooking the Sonoma Valley, this wine was blended with 5% Petite Sirah. While not as high in alcohol as some of the producer's other wines, it has a concentrated character on the palate, akin to blueberry syrup, with soft, moderate tannins and a dusty texture. Red and black cherry provide additional fruit flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Nebbiolo, Barbera and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is deeply concentrated, offering pretty aromas of cherry, spice and cola.

The finish is intense, fresh and firm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Past vintages of Moccagatta's Basarin Barbaresco have been stellar, but this bottling still needs time to find its feet. The fruit is youthful and raw; the tannins are tight and astringent.

Juicy, rich and concentrated, this is worth aging for at least five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the winery's highest-end bottling, this year a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese, from Alexander Valley and Mount Veeder. It's charming to drink now, with deep, impressively ripe blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors wrapped into soft, thick tannins. The finish is dry. Despite the deliciousness factor, it should hold and develop for at least six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This juicy and simple blend of 40% Merlot with Syrah, Petite Sirah and Cabernet Sauvignon offers chewy, dense tannins and a lingering spiciness of leather and tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This majority varietal wine contains 2% Cabernet Sauvignon, which doesn't help to soften its powerful grip of sturdy tannin and sideshow of oak. Blueberry and chocolate come to the fore slowly between meaty leather and a dusty aroma.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite originating in a hot year, this smells lightly herbaceous and green, with scents of olive, bell pepper and tomato leaf. The mouthfeel is chunky and solid, with tomatoey acidity. Herbal, spicy flavors of tomato and plum finish peppery, spicy and with moderate heat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A hearty but not overdone blend of 73% Petite Sirah, 18% Tannat and 9% Petit Verdot, this well-named wine shows asphalt, black pepper, violet and a sourish blueberry on the nose.

The palate has some dark cherry flavor, but also a green, astringent character and a warm midpalate, while the finish is bitter and drying.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite its time in bottle, this wine has years to go before it sleeps. It still needs further integration of its substantial body of tannin and tobacco within the layers of sanguine game, pencil lead and plum. In addition, it would benefit from being enjoyed with food, preferably medium-rare steak. Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Notes of tart apple, fresh orange and yellow mirabelle plum announce pure-fruited joy. These flavors pervade nose and palate and are even more highlighted by a zesty, bright, lemony freshness on the concentrated, almost lip-smacking palate. This is dry and refreshing, taut and concentrated with a lasting, lemony finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rooty aromas of raisin and stewed plum are a touch hot as this tips the scale at 15.5%.

A sip reveals blackberry, dark chocolate, cola and a bit of smoke flavorings, proving plush yet brisk, ripe yet restrained with a rocky minerality.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, woodland berry and crushed rose unfold in the glass. The firm palate offers mature red cherry, strawberry, clove, mint and licorice alongside tightly knit, austere tannins that need to unwind.

Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of black berries, toasted oak and spice. On the palate, notes of espresso, roasted coffee bean and vanilla back up ripe black cherry but drying wood tannins give it an abrupt finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deeply purple aromas of acai fruit and grape Jolly Rancher candies get a bit more serious with the scent of smoked cigars. The grape-juice element carries to the easy-to-drink, not overly complex palate, which will work well with food or just by itself.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nice everyday wine, with pleasant peach, pineapple and pear flavors that finish with a touch of smoky oak and vanilla. It's easy to enjoy this one with ham, crab, corn on the cob or just by itself.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Except for some excessive sharpness in the finish, this is a lush, opulent young Cab. It shows ripe cassis, chocolate and oak flavors wrapped into firm, sweet tannins. That sharpness may limit ageability.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A note of flinty reduction still hovers above the nose, signalling a wine still needing bottle age. Underneath, juicy peaches are enlivened with notes of fresh, tart passion fruit. The final picture is one of balanced poise and lasting, juicy aroma. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft notes of rose petal and peach compote animate the nose. A restrained, floral medium sweetness envelopes the palate, shimmering with notes of honeysuckle and bitter grapefruit pith. Gently balanced, this wine has just the right amount of floral perfume.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the second label of Young Inglewood, a blend of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon, 4% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot that spent 20 months in all-French oak, one quarter of it new. Meant to be approachable young, it is, while retaining a concentration of licorice, black currant and blackberry wrapped in dark chocolate. Firm tannins give it structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here is a rich and dense style of Brunello with bright berry tones and ripe cherry followed by cedar, cola and spice. The wine is rich and opulent in the mouth with great intensity, soft tannins and well integrated acidity. La Mannella really steps forward in terms of quality with this vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty notes of Italian espresso, chocolate and spice revolve around a core of solid black fruit. This is an elegant and refined wine that boats a traditional style that is never overdone or too powerful. In fact, it showcases its delicate berry nuances very nicely in the mouth. Drink after 2014.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: At first blush this reserve seems more oaky, more open and more overtly alcoholic than the just-released Leonetti 2008 Merlot and 2007 Cabernet Sauvignon. After many hours of breathing time it fills in with pretty plummy fruit, toast, caramel, whiffs of smoke, cedar and cigar box, and dry tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very rich Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but quite tannic. You want to give it some time in the cellar. Dry and full-bodied, it shows ripe, deep flavors of blackberry jam, black currants, dark chocolate and anise, with smoky overtones from oak. Feels dramatic and impressive. Give it until 2012 to come around.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous Brunello with thick and succulent aromas of black fruit, spice, cedar wood, leather and pipe tobacco. It offers a lot of in terms of complexity and intensity but is never overdone or exaggerated. In the mouth, it fills the palate with beautifully bright cherry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a plump, ripe and round Brunello with bright berry tones followed by mesquite wood, cedar, pipe tobacco and leather. All together, this is a full and generous wine with impressive longevity on the palate. Pair it with pork, lamb or beef.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a beautifully evolved Brunello with notes of cherry, cola and spice backed by dark and penetrating notes of blackberry, plum and tar. This wine delivers thick, solid aromas and a bold, succulent style with smooth softness and intensity in the mouth. Very nice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's not easy to find mature Rioja from a great winery and a great year. This is all that; it smells of tobacco, earth and dried fruits. The palate is lively and not dying, while the flavors of cherry, raisin and marzipan are spot on. Compact and long on the finish, indicating that it still has another 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 years in it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a polished mineral note here of lead pencil or graphite that gives this wine very direct and immediate appeal. At the back, you'll notice subtle tones of black fruit, plum, ripe cherry and spice. The wine is concentrated and dense with drying tannins at the close. This beautiful wine can age many more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Narrow, pointed aromas of licorice and snappy, herbal fruits filter into a hard, tannic palate. Flavors of red berries and currants are pushed by blazing acidity, while the finish is firm as rocks and tastes a bit green and minty. For a 2005, this is showing its cards; drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, this Tuscan offering has aromas of grilled bell pepper and cedar wood. Oak dominates the palate, which also shows red currants, chocolate and espresso along with aggressive and astringent wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy blackberry and black currant coast across a softly layered wine that's approachable and ready to drink, dusted in tannins and dried herbs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Proper Nuits-St.-Georges, all dry tannins powering through the dark cherry fruit flavors, and balanced with tasty acidity. There's great potential here, the ripe fruits just showing their intensity, but for the moment, the tannins are the core.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Firm and hard, this shows density rather than fruit, tannin rather than freshness. It goes for the dark side of Clos Vougeot. There is some bitterness from the extraction, but the wine needs many years before it comes into balance\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the juicy red fruit finish promises richness later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of rich, heady flavors in this delicious young Cabernet Sauvignon. It appeals now for the intense blackberry, cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and anise flavors, but such is the tannic intensity that it should easily age. Hold until 2015 and try again.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A potent brew of raisin, blackberry, minerality and leather comes together to form a bold, very ripe bouquet. The palate is chunky and forward, with beefy tannins and full-force flavors of blackberry, black peppercorn and toast. A huge and massive wine with a sweet, toasty, ripe and candied finish. Drink now through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth, deep and fairly complex on the bouquet, with concentrated dark fruit aromas blending with coconut. The palate shows structure, tightness and full but integrated tannins, while the flavors of black fruits, herbs, tea and spice set up a full, toasted finish that satisfies. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the owners of another marquee vineyard nearby, Sun Chase, this wine is expressive and expansive on the palate, dark red-purple in color, thick and dense on the palate. Blackberry, black plum and black pepper rise to the fore, built along a continuum of earthy forest floor. Tannin and oak are interwoven well, before a soft finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Merlot, this dense, extracted wine opens with aromas of vanilla, new oak, ripe black fruit, mocha and roasted coffee beans. The palate offers oak extract, coconut, toast, chocolate, fleshy plum and blackberries alongside velvety tannins. It's still resting heavily on its oak so give it a few years to integrate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing how Saint-\\u00c3\\u0089milion came out well in 2013, this wine has ripe and juicy Merlot fruits topped with perfumed Cabernet Franc. Rich and structured, it's a wine for aging over the medium-term with its layers of tannins under the fruit. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This impressive wine is full of potential. Powerful wood flavors are currently masking the fruitiness of the wine. However the weight of fruit and the rich texture promise good long-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the mighty Hyde in Carneros, this medium-bodied white blossoms with tropical fruit and briny minerality, a forceful combination that gives this wine both power and elegance. Textured in candied Meyer lemon, it finishes crisply and the right kind of sour.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows lovely floral aromas and hints of chocolate and berry. The palate offers ripe black cherry, spice and coffee, and while this is still tannic, the tannins are ripe and composed. This is already drinking well, so enjoy it soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo boasts an intense fragrance of orange peel, Alpine forest and berry. The palate has ample intensity and shows ripe cherry, mint, cinnamon and espresso notes. The wine is well balanced, with big but smooth tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard Barolo shows ripe berry aromas and whiffs of incense and espresso. The palate shows almost overripe cherry fruit, layered with herbs, coffee and underbrush notes. It has big but ripe tannins and is fast approaching optimum drinkability. Enjoy it over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Albino Rocca's Barbaresco Ronchi boasts lovely violet and sage aromas sprinkled with coffee and espresso notes. The palate shows creamy red fruit layered with chocolate and spice and firm but refined tannins. This is very elegant but still a bit shy, so best to drink it after 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Pinot is too tart and tannic to drink now, though it has great potential. You have to search for the fruit, but it's there, in deeply hidden layers of cherries and red currants. Dry and stubborn now, but don't give up. It will reward cellaring for a minimum of six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Golden in color, this is a creamy voluptuous white wine, fermented and aged entirely in new French oak. Melon, spicy nutmeg and fig build flavor around a core of thick texture and concentration, finishing in buttery toast.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barbaresco's leather, violet, crushed mint, coconut and exotic spice aromas follow through to the palate, which is bright with red cherry and coffee notes. Fine-grained tannins offer support while high-toned acidity lends balance.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A complete wine. As it starts in the mouth, there is a feeling of everything in its place. The tannins are initially soft, dusty rather than dry; then the dark plums, red berries and so-sweet strawberries come into play. And finally, they all come together in a climax of richness and freshness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A beautiful wine, smooth, polished, with rounded corners. Its intense fruit is balanced and harmonizes well with the sweet tannins, the layers of wood and the red berry flavors. Certainly powerful, it impresses equally with the pleasure it will give in 7\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a powerhouse of a wine. It is driven forward by immense tannins as well as by superrich fruit that still keeps itself in check by a velvet texture. There is spice, acidity, some toast and vanilla, and finally a sunburst of warmth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A supremely integrated wine, its richness and beautiful fruit just part of a story that starts with intense aromas and segues on the palate into a balance of tannins, dark red fruits, enveloping acidity and a beautifully orchestrated finale of berries, spice and aching freshness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This very expensive release is one of the rare examples of Chardonnay that absolutely requires bottle age. Dry and leesy now, with a mineral compactness, it shows a rich core of baked peach, spiced apple, butterscotch and smoky honey. As it warms in the glass, it develops great flavor and textural complexities. Should come into its own by 2009, and improve for many years after.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast. This is shot through with acidity and some dense tannins, but above all it is the piercing fruit that dominates. One of Jadot's signature wines, it is wonderful, with considerable aging potential.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dalmau, the ultrapremium Tempranillo blend from Marques de Murrieta, is 65% pricier in 2004 than '03. And that might be justified. This is a spectacular wine in every sense of the word. The nose blends alluring scents of smoke, asphalt, rubber and black fruit. The palate is saturated and smooth, with black cherry and blackberry flavors leading the way. Coffee, berry pie and mocha help the finish hold court and then fade away. Already good but best from 2010\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opulent yet so elegant, this wine has already achieved great balance. It comes from the soft richness of the generous fruit, the spice from both the wood and the fruit, and the roundness of the texture, which envelops you in its warmth and ripeness. And, at the end, just to give a great lift, along comes the acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: For the second vintage in a row, Vall Llach's signature red blend is out on its own. The bouquet is round and deep, with alluring cola, mint and blackberry aromas. The palate is alive but still quite dark, with huge black plum and blackberry flavors. Super long on the finish, with a subtle streak of vanilla and coconut. Delicious but also deft. 450 cases produced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The pedigree of this Cabernet shows in the incredible depth of flavor and softly gentle, complex tannins. With intensely concentrated blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and oak flavors, it's distinctly Napa-esque. It is, however, compromised by sharp acidity that's noticeable throughout the palate experience.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blueberry, dried lilac, crushed violet and black pepper form a classic nose on this Merlot-led Bordeaux blend from Paso Robles' celebrated Westside. The well-integrated, complex palate features fruit, herbs, spice and tar, as if each one plays back-to-back solos.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 50% Syrah, 23% Petite Sirah, 17% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre and 10% Grenache presents a delicious strawberry cake nose, backed up with dried purple flowers and cigar box backbone. On the palate, elegant purple fruits are laced with leather and pepper, finishing with a cleansing tartness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of crushed plum, asphalt, oak, toast, exotic spice and forest floor lead the nose.

The palate shows black cherry, carob, bitter cocoa, white pepper and sage alongside bracing tannins that leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From winemaker Bryan Kane, who also makes the Howell Mountain Vineyards' wines, comes this tiny-production Cabernet Sauvignon from two separate Howell Mountain sources. A delight in black plum, licorice and peppery leather, it's soft and complex. Boysenberry highlights the fruit components, while the finish is deftly marked by wild vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light and muted, with sharp, leafy and herbal flavors. It seems to be drying out, leaving an impression of mushrooms rather than fruit. Drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is chock full of freshly crushed black pepper and blackberry jam flavor. It's big in tannins, but large proportions of aging in new French oak gives it hints of toast and a caramelized touch. The wine is disappointing given the bottling's history, but it's likely the chilly vintage that undermined it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a good example of what's so disturbing about the rash of expensive Cabernets and blends that has possessed the minds of consumers. This is an awkward, cumbersome wine. Sure, the fruit is as ripe as anything on earth, but what good is extract if it doesn't have balance? The wine is excessively soft. It's cloying, and to add insult to injury, it's tannic. There are wines that cost one-fifth the price that are far better.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: All five Bordeaux grapes are blended in this aromatic wine sourced from the Seven Hills and Pepper Bridge vineyards. In the mouth it is compact with a dense verticality, opening with raspberry and moving on into cassis fruit. Tight and young, compact and nicely structured, this should be cellared through 2022 to 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: You'll find lots of fresh, ripe Cabernet flavor in this young, tannic wine. It's rich in blackberries, black currants and dark plums, with a juicy, oozing melted quality. However, those tannins are quite strong. You can certainly drink it now, but it's better to start enjoying it in 2018 and through the mid-2020s.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Duhart-Milon continues to get better and more sophisticated. This 2011 vintage shows that trend well with its elegant spice, black currant fruits and firm tannins. The fruitiness is well focused, with typical Cabernet acidity bringing out the fresher side of the wine. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A long-time producer of great Chardonnay, Flora Springs hits a new level with this reserve commemorative bottling. The wine is spectacularly rich in tropical fruits, green apples and limes, with elaborate buttered toast and vanilla flavors from new oak, and a wonderfully creamy, leesy complexity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The Cherryblock Cabs seem to share a common minty characteristic that's particularly noticeable in this vintage. There's also a decent amount of cassis, earth and tobacco, and the finish remains firmly tannic. Drink or hold.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gorgeous, soft and rich with velvety firm tannins, Balifico would pair with spicy marinated pork or slow cooked-beef. The plushness is what sets this wine apart as do its fine aromas of blackberry, leather and black cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coniale is one of those beautifully balanced Italian Cabs that is plush and dense, but elegant and fine at the same time. The wine boast ripened blackberry and cassis and there is not a green note in sight. Indeed, soft spice and firm tannins promise a bright aging future.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 2006 vintage presents elegant, refined tones and this blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah does just that. There's a nice fullness to the wine that is reflected in the integration of its aromatic elements. Chocolate, red cherry and exotic spice linger long on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hard tannins, dryness and oakiness are the three horsemen that mark this young, vital Cabernet. Is it ageworthy? Absolutely. Once the fruit kicks in, which is pretty much instantly, it's devastatingly rich and spicy in blackberries, blueberries and cassis. Clearly a cellar candidate for at least the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lush and dark, with balance throughout. The nose oozes blackberry and fine oak, while the palate is thick and meaty, with dark berry and vanilla as the prime flavors. Solid, textured and rich, with a long, lasting, complex finish of tobacco, vanilla, mixed spices and chocolate. Drink now through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This lovely blend of Sangiovese (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Canaiolo shows the super Tuscan side of a storied wine region like Montalcino. Indeed, Castello Romitorio is one of the best Brunello producers and this wine shows their expertise with other grape varieties. Blackberry, soft spice and fruity fullness characterize the mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a two-acre block planted to the variety within this stately place, more famous for Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is herbal in dried sage, girded in big tannin and exhibiting plenty of density. Leathery black fruit, especially currant, and black pepper provoke the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This successful riserva displays opulence and a bold, modern style that focuses on bright cherry and savory spice aromas. The wine is loaded with density and richness, and combines a ripe soft feel with a lively berries on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While the aromas of this young wine reveal considerable toast, on the palate the wine brings forward the ripe apricot and mango flavors to go with that wood. As it matures, these elements will coalesce with the taut, tense mineral texture into an superb, ageworthy terroir-driven wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This rich wine balances ripe yellow fruits with intense citrus acidity in a harmonious whole. Its structure is laden with minerality, toast and a smooth, delicious creamy aftertaste.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Bold and elegant at the same time. Packs a powerful punch in a silk glove.

There are also pretty dustings of dry mineral and dried herb at the back. This is a bold Brunello with power, determination, structure and balance. It needs at least 10 years of cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A plump and juicy Brunello with bold, fresh fruit and loads of aromatic intensity.

Sharp and young, with a potent, liquorous finish, this explosive bottle of cassis-driven fruit should cellar well for a decade or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fine and delicate Brunello shows soft elegance and sophistication in the form of cassis, wild berry, white pepper, root beer, toasted nut and cigar tobacco. The mouthfeel is firm and clean, with elements of tannic structure and fresh acidity that work well together. The oak element still needs time to integrate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A Brunello with broad shoulders and a powerful bouquet that delivers bright, bold aromas of ripe fruit, dark spice, leather and dried tobacco. The wine's structure and dark fruit flavors move evenly over the palate with smoothness and harmony.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Delicate embroidered with sage, eucalyptus, cola, wild berry, white cherry, rum cake and savory spice, this wine shows the kind of pretty berry aromas that are brighter than they are intense.

Age for at least five years, preferably 10.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The balance of this wine is what makes it so impressive. Spice and yellow fruit intermingle effortlessly. There is a core of tight, coiled steel, like a spring, which gives minerality along with the richness. At the end, acidity lifts the wine, finishing with freshness as well as intensity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lots of fresh herbs and spices in this beautiful red wine. Offers loads of red and black currants and chocolate, with a fine application of cedar and cigar box from oak. Very fine, enormously likeable. Drink now through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: What makes a great Chablis grand cru? It's the intensity of flavor, which can be found in this wine. Its green and white fruits are layered with wood spice and an ineffable crispness that allows the wine to show the purity of Chardonnay and the great terroir at the same time.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Smells a bit minty and peppery, but once in the mouth, turns ultra-generous in black currant, chocolate-covered mint and spicy cedar flavors. Massive, yet refined and elegant, and even with the firm tannins, grows more charming as it warms in the glass. Very fine quality, and likely to hold for many years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful wine, a pure expression of ripe but steely Chardonnay. The wine floats onto the palate, with green plums and citrus leading. Then come toast, a mouthwatering acidity and a mineral structure. This wine's complexity just continues to impress.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A drop-dead gorgeous red blend that continues Flora Springs' fine streak of Bordeaux-style wines.

Drink this high-quality wine now and through 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a bright star in Olivier Leflaive's firmament, a wondrous big, rich wine that is just so finely poised. The structure is dense, rich, fat and full-bodied, a hymn to ripe fruit. Flavors are fruit-driven at this stage, but this is a wine that will develop over many years, if you can resist the urge to indulge its luxuriant tastes now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is from a sub-division of the Corton vineyard, at the northern end of the Grand Cru. It shows both depth of flavor and freshness, a ripe wine that brings in delicious, appetizing acidity and spicy toast. It will obviously age, the nuts and secondary flavors still waiting to show, but as a fruitier style it will be ready in a year.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Smells young and juvenile, a bit raw. Shows briary aromas of wild berries, thyme, cherries and mocha. A chewy wine, tannic and spicy. Hard now, a bit austere, but beautifully structured, with a thick, currant-infused taste. Needs time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, powerful brush strokes of ripe fruits, spice and rich creaminess paint this wine with vividness. The fruit envelops the mouth, the pears, green plums and ripe apples working with a citrus edge. Impressive, and with a great finishing freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dry, tannic and bursting in dusty red fruit, this is a majority varietal with 20% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. Brawny and broodingly full bodied, it finishes leathery and smoky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A mix of 48% Merlot, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, all from Pickberry Vineyard, this wine is surprisingly light bodied and lean, despite a big presence of tobacco and grippy leather. The fruit is elusive, finishing with a flurry of cedar and clove.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Fine ripe fruit here, with soft, sweet berries and surprisingly smooth tannins. The wine is rich, not heavyweight, but glorying in the opulence of Pinot Noir. The finish brings on the tannins again.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard is in the heart of the Rutherford bench. The wine is rich in fruit and tannins, but a bit clumsy, with a chunky, tannic mouthfeel and jammy, direct blackberry and blueberry fruit flavors. Not ready for drinking now, but well-made, and should age well, as Cabs from this stretch tend to have a long life.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Solid, foursquare wine, full of structure and fruit, bringing light tannins into play with black plums and sweet acidity. But the wine also has a lightness of touch, offering approachability as well as concentration.

Finishing richly, this is not a Grand Cru for aging, but it does wear its ripe fruit easily with a good burst of steely acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich wine that shows the power of Gevrey, even in a lesser vintage. The fruit fills the glass with aromas of red plums, sweet raspberries and cranberry juice. There is spice here along with juicy fresh acidity. It is worth aging 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years, but is delicious now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With wood and white stone fruit in fine balance, this is a ripe, full wine, the acidity lighting up the ripe flavor. The wine has a broad character, ready for drinking in a year.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Appealing modern-leaning aromas of root beer, berry fruits and vanilla settle with airing and turn more mellow and traditional for Rioja. Slightly plush on the palate, especially given 2013's cool nature, this is balanced despite showing raw tannins. Toasty blackened flavors of baked berry fruits, chocolate and licorice finish long, toasty and peppery. Drink through 2025\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy black and red cherry flavors enwrap classic cedar, graphite and peppercorn notes in this brawny, full-bodied wine. Accessible despite its bulk of tannin, its texture leans leathery, with clove scents lingering long on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pronounced mature plum, black-skinned berry, vanilla, dark spice and French oak aromas lift out of the glass.

This is rich, full of firm tannins and with a solid structure and future. Blackberry flavors are dark and intense and the wine needs time. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vines grown on thin soil close to the stony subsoil produce this tight, taught and mineral wine. With acidity, structured tannins and concentration, the wine is still starting out. It is a dark wine with black fruits that need time to fully develop. Drink this intense wine from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from village appellation vineyards. It is soft and without the powerful tannins often found in the area. It compensates with dark berry fruits and some ripe tannins that are finely integrated into the wine. Acidity at the end adds to the potential of this wine which will be best from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Premier Cru vineyard is on a high point in the village. It has produced a rich fruity wine with great structure and dense tannins. Bold red fruits are dominant with the acidity in a supporting role. The wine is rich, full and needing to age. Drink this wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Baked blueberries, peppery allspice, wet gravel and a touch of vanilla show on this nose of this blend of 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 70% Shiraz, a spelling of Syrah used to reflect the owner's Persian heritage. Those elements are very well integrated on the palate, where a cedar-laced frame presents lots of dark red fruit and crushed spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of plum, violets, orange peel, earth and herb are followed by palate-staining fruit flavors. A lengthy finish caps it off.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This boldly structured wine opens with aromas of baked plum, clove, tobacco and graphite.

The flavors are tart and brambly, with the tannins needing some time to stretch their legs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very smoky nose is reminsicent of mocha. This oaky spice is also very evident on the light, red-fruited body. There is a bitter edge to the soft tannins but also a warm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a classically crafted Barolo with Nebbiolo's quintessential fragrance of rose, cherry and balsamic herbs. The palate is still tightly wound but shows wild cherry and spice, with firm but fine tannins. Needs time to develop complexity. Best after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an excellent effort from this scalding vintage.

Blackberries, cherries and chocolate nibs explode in the mouth, but it's no mere fruit bomb. The tannins and acids lend it integrity, and the finish is miraculously dry. A superb job, and as good as it is now, should develop over the next 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 years, depending on how old you like your Cabs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another successful 2011 from this winery, in fact the best of their six new Pinots. Shows the brilliant acidity and light, delicate texture of the coast, with the concentrated fruit, cola and spice flavors this esteemed vineyard is noted for. Highly complex and dry, it's delicious to drink now, and should age well for a good six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nothing but excellence emanates from the nose of this cool, crisp, focused Tempranillo. The mouthfeel is currently young and tannic, but the wine's structure is just right and its future is bright. Flavors of licorice, spice and blackberry lead to a lively finish with flavors of mocha, chocolate and fine herbs. Best from 2014\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice. The palate shows ripe black cherry, vanilla and sweet spice flavors, as well as a hint of licorice. This has nice depth and balance, but will be more complex after 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a base of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon this robust red adds Petit Verdot, Merlot and Malbec to concoct a soft, smooth and juicy red wine that's brooding in personality. The tannins are tar-like and sizable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A majority Cabernet Sauvignon with 14% Merlot blended in, Artemis is aromatically inviting in dark plum, currant and a streak of herb. Light, lean and well-balanced, the wine features soft, barely perceptible tannins. Tri-tip is a wise pairing suggestion.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark and earthy, with a streak of soy and a hint of funk, this complex effort opens powerfully, then turns more subtle, with plum and chocolate highlights. It's one of those wines that never stops evolving in the glass.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Just one barrel was made from this vineyard, which suffered losses from frost and wildlife in 2010. A shame, because the wine is terrific, delicate for Syrah, with boysenberry, raspberry, piercing acidity and refined tannins. Built to age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One word describes this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094huge. It's thick and dense in the mouth, with considerable tannins framing ripe, complex flavors of blackberries, currants, green olives, mocha and toasty oak. In need of aging, it should begin to mellow after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This young wine needs some time in the cellar. Released at the age of two years, it's mouthwatering in acidity with fresh, juicy cranberry, raspberry jam and persimmon flavors that finish spicy and long. The alcohol is refreshingly low, adding to the delicate mouthfeel. Drink 2017 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Concentrated aromas of black currant, lilac, wisteria and a hint of charcoal show on the nose of this very dark bottling, the first 100% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre from this property. The tannins are very soft and massaging to the palate, physically coating the mouth through the sip and delivering flavors of grape Jolly Rancher and creme de cassis. The steadily rising acidity helps cut through it all.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky bacon and a bittersweet element of black tea make for an exotically spicy, complex and full-bodied wine from the mighty vineyard site overlooking the Petaluma Gap. Black cherry, pomegranate and cardamom are wrapped in a swaddling of toasted oak, while the mouthfeel is dense and concentrated.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a powerful bottling, as is expected by this producer, showing fresh boysenberry, purple flower potpourri, tart black plums and a touch of rosemary on the nose. It's undeniably delicious at first sip, with caramelized blackberry and hints of thyme and rosemary. The texture is squeaky and sticky, and it's a bit sweet and boozy, but a definite Paso crowd-pleaser.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Zinfandel and 5% Petit Verdot, a block and barrel selection of the producer's best lots, this is a well-made, impressive wine. Leather saddle and robust tannin is accented by dried herb, espresso and smoke, making for a burly explosion of blackberry and cherry.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very tasty and large in scale, it sports a huge nose of dark plum and heavy cedar, along with cinnamon and vanilla accents wrapped in very toasty oak. Very dark fruit with licorice shadings and an elegant, supple mouthfeel add to the appeal. The dark flavors and heavy toast continue on the long finish, which doesn't want to quit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A full load of berry fruit in the nose, black-currant flavors and extremely even balance. It features an attractive set of cherry and cassis flavors, and the heavy tannins that hit home on the long finish, while fairly starching, don't stand in the way of the overall pleasure it gives.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry aromas have a Port-like character and a smoky undertone. Big extraction leaves a thick, weighty mouthfeel and the essence of Cabernet's sweetness. Some mineral, coffee and meat on the lengthy finish. A good mix of finesse and wildness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Cassis liqueur, blueberry notes and a smoky cured-meat element comprise the nose of this engaging, beautifully balanced offering. Dried cherry, cedar, tea and tobacco flavors predominate, and the texture is supple. The long finish displays handsome cherry and coffee notes, with plentiful but even tannins. Almost drinkable now, but best after 2002.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich, lush melange of fruit and nuts, with sinuous, almost unctuous flavors that twine around the palate like a snake. Long, fascinating finish, elegantly balanced and precise.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ultraripe berry, herb, cedar, and toast aromas. Refined plum, licorice, and coffee flavors show great appeal, and the supple, elegant mouthfeel plays into the finish with dark fruit and cocoa-powder notes. Bright tannins and good fruit-to-acid balance promise a fine future. Hold for two to four years; drink to 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Floral, exciting and chocolaty, this is a dense, rich, well-crafted beauty. Yummy is one of the best ways to describe it. It has full but friendly tannins, all the length you could ask for, and in the final analysis it leaves an impression of heft and significance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another wine in what we have come to call the \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cblack-beauty\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d style. It has heavily toasted oak, espresso, black cherry and menthol aromas and flavors. The fruit seems subdued here, but the wine is nevertheless well integrated, with a full mouthfeel and long finish. One of the best of this style; cellar it for four to six years, and it should drink nicely to 2010.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very aromatic, showing a complex nose of cherry, spice, smoked and raw meat, and tobacco. The flavors are copious, too, with strong black cherry, licorice and tobacco elements. Balance and structure are beautiful here, and the coffee-chocolate finish has very good length, showing spice and blueberry accents. Lovely already, it will be better in four years and will drink well to 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Maduro cigars, cedar, beef char and pipe ash highlight the nose on this blend of 48% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Cabernet Franc and 20% Merlot from a longtime producer. It's relatively lean and light on the palate, with black peppercorns and roasted pork elements. The Cab Franc shows strongly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak extract, resin, toast and prune lead the nose. The extracted palate offers dried black cherry, baked plum, coconut and vanilla alongside abrasive tannins that leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe, dark berry, cured meat, leather and game emerge on this wine. The dense, extracted palate offers vanilla, oak, toast, coconut and dried plum alongside astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very ripe and jammy, showing primary fruit blackberries, cherries, black currants and cola, and lots of new, smoky oak. A big wine wrapped into big, sweet tannins that's tasting a bit direct now. The suggestion is ageability. With the grapes coming off two mountains, Howell and Veeder, it should cruise through the next 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 4th edition of MunJebel (a blend of Nerello Mascalese from both the 2006 and 2007 vintages) is one of Cornelissen's nicest wines. There's bright fruit here and an attractive purity that speaks highly of the dramatic volcanic conditions that have shaped it. It's a special wine with a light color and delicate aspect.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty mineral tones of delicate talc power and dried flowers frame a powerful wine that reveals a dense core of dried fruit and raisins at its heart. This Amarone is dense and sweet in the mouth with chewy tannins and good length.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an inky, black Amarone that is redolent of black fruit, plum, BBQ sauce, root beer and mesquite smoke. Pair this wine with thick beef ragout over oven-roasted pasta or game dishes. The wine is sticky and ripe in the mouth with firm tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A severe wine, its structure deriving from an important wood element and fruit tannins. It brings out apple and green plum skins, with a tangy texture that demands a few months aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This traditionally crafted single-vineyard Barolo shows the forward nature of the vintage but is an excellent effort, with overripe berry, truffle and forest floor aromas. The palate shows ripe black cherry, prune and spice with firm but fine tannins. This is almost ready now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094enjoy it over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This soft Barolo shows ripe berry, orange peel and toast notes. The palate shows ripe dark fruit, spice, hints of chocolate and firm but ripe tannins. This shows the hot, forward  nature of the vintage and is already enjoyable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a Barbaresco with fragrant and floral aromas of violet, rose, ripe berry and oak. The palate still needs to open up, but already shows bright cherry, strawberry and white pepper. This is vibrant, with bracing tannins that need time to soften. Best after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers subtle black-skinned fruit, leafy underbrush and cooking spice aromas. The dense, forward palate shows dried cherry, blackberry jam and licorice notes, with assertive tannins that leave a firm finish. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Reserved at first, this Brunello gradually reveals tilled soil and black-skinned fruit aromas. The dense, straightforward palate displays ripe plum and clove notes with a hint of licorice and closed-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and leather aromas lead the nose. The palate is firm, offering plum, toast, mocha and tobacco flavors, while assertive tannins leave a taut finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy truffle, porcini mushroom, herb and game scents fill the glass. The palate is robust with rustic appeal, offering dried cherry, cured meat, sage and a salty finish. Grainy tannins provide support, while alcohol leaves a warmth on the finish. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is assertive with black currant and chocolate flavors, but saved from being a fruit bomb by intricate tannins and a nice hit of acidity. The fleshy fruitiness is best enjoyed now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bit high in alcohol, this has blackberry and mocha flavors that are overripe, veering into sweet-prune territory. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This edition of Rosso del Soprano from boutique winemaker Salvatore Geraci offers bright berry tones with easy background notes of almond, pistachio and tobacco. There's also a drying mineral note of crushed stone or talcum power that gives the wine backbone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Impressive from the start for its rich blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, thick tannins and sweet overlay of smoky oak. Could be an ager, but some bitterness in the middle suggests the fruit will fall out before the tannins resolve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is soft, fruity and immediately accessible. Red-berry fruit and balanced acidity are paired with red cherry and soft tannins. The wine is juicy and will be ready to drink from late 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard Tempranillo is masculine and dark, as evidenced by aromas of licorice, pepper, blackberry, coconut and campfire. It's mouthfilling and oaky, with toasty, dark, baked-fruit flavors that lead to a finish defined by licorice and clove. Overall it's black, spicy and impressive; drink from 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello opens with inky, dark concentration and definitely shows a chewy, almost raw quality of cherry fruit that will most likely disappear withdonn just two or three more years of cellar aging. Cola, spice, leather and smoke fill in the rear and the wine ends with crisp acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Altesino is part of an elite group of vintners that really put Montalcino on the international wine map. Its 2008 Brunello shows some of the nervous acidity that is typical of the vintage, but it also delivers soft tones of cherry fruit, spice and chocolate that round off any sharp edges.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This selection offers balance and integrated aromas of spice, dark fruit, leather, tobacco, cola and rum cake. The wine shows power and heft both in terms of alcohol and consistency. Smoothly polished, fine tannins appear on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a savory, almost chewy side to this Brunello that is enhanced by aromas of tobacco, spice, dark cola, licorice, blackberry and currant. The wine shows balance and intensity with a soft, plush feel in the mouth that stands in pleasing contrast against to wine's young tannins and acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gran is a step up from Mora's crianza. The nose deals marzipan, blackberry, raisin and chocolate aromas in front of a smooth, layered palate with toasted berry, vanilla and chocolate flavors. There's a ton of oak on this wine, creating a vanilla and caramel character on the finish. Drink now through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Girifalco is an interesting expression of Sangiovese that shows a very bold and modern side to this characteristic grape from central Italy.

Bright acidity creates a cooling sensation in the mouth and would pair well with creamy or cheesy pasta dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Following in the footsteps of this estate's successful Rosso di Montalcino (from the same vintage), this Brunello opens with soft tones of cherry and chocolate with slightly offbeat aromas of cookie dough or almond paste.

You'll recognize tones of sweet berry fruit, cinnamon, tobacco and even a touch of zesty ginger snap. The wine feels silky and firm with bright freshness on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From grapes grown in Pope Valley, the eastern part of the Napa Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 2% Petit Verdot. Smoky bacon and thick, concentrated waves of blackberry mark the wine, which is made by Ted Osborne of Olabisi. The finish is dark and chocolaty, with more of that smoke.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a density and concentration to this wine that many will find appealing, a mix of leathery cigar box and unfussy notions of clove and currant. Silky-smooth on the palate, it's full bodied and robust, made entirely from Cabernet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Saucy aromas are more earthy and herbal than fruity and rich. This feels chunky, clunky and tannic, while flavors of blackened spices, herbal berry fruits and tomato sauce finish tannic but also low on acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a dark and sophisticated red, with an interesting aromatic profile that includes dried rosemary, sage, cola, blackberry, leather and spice. It's thick and powerful on the close and should pair well with red meat.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Immediately, you know you are before a great Brunello with bright fruit aromas backed by forest floor, balsam notes, bramble, blue flowers, red apple and mint.

It has all the right elements coming into place, along with weight and some elegance.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A big, burly wine, powerful, concentrated and packed with fruit, the tannins a potential aging advantage underneath all this delicious fruit. Solid, but charming at the same time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful rounded wine, full of juicy fruit, but sustained by a strong tannic structure. This dryness suggests good aging potential, as does the ripeness of the fruit and the acidity. Keep for at least 6 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A round, full-bodied wine that goes for the generous, opulent fruity aspect of red Burgundy with its big, blowsy red fruits, just kept in check by tannins. The acidity is lively and fresh, keeping pace with the intense vibrant fruits. Screwcap.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An impressive wine, fueled by black plum juice flavors. The acidity is just right, balancing the richness of the fruit. The wine revels in the serious side of Echezeaux, packed with dark, tight tannins over the fruit.

It is leavened with great perfumes, while the overall effect is dark, brooding and concentrated.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Castelgiocondo's Brunello aptly represents the new face of Montalcino with its plump, well-extracted and modern style. The wine is packed with soft black cherry, chocolate and coffee aromas and shows a smooth, long-lasting finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big, rich, almost velvet in texture, this is a powerful wine.

Powerful wine for long-term aging and medium-term accessibility.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This thick, masculine expression of Brunello offers loads of rich spice, vanilla, moist tobacco, smoked bacon, toasted coconut and black fruit. The oak element is present but also well integrated and gives extra dimension and personality overall.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A little more raisiny than expected, but that's offset by a brilliant floral streak and more dominant blackberry, blueberry and black plum flavors. Finishes with a mix of freshness, delicious prune fruit and chocolate. Tasted blind, like we do in almost all cases, this wine was easy to identify as Calvario; it has a uniqueness to its fruit. Drink now through 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello Riserva shows a very rich and dark side thanks to its firm structure and integrated acidity. Blackberry and dark fruit tones are backed by dense concentration and extraction. Bets are on that this wine will age beautifully over time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an elaborately constructed wine, rich in fruit and tannins, and far better than the rather ordinary 2006. But it's nowhere near ready to drink now. Erupts with ripe, juicy blackberries, black cherries, minerals and sweet cassis. The grapes are from the Pope Valley region. Very big, bold and dramatic, but immature. Hold for a good six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made by celebrated winemaker Vittorio Fiore, this gorgeous Sangiovese-based wine shows the lavish intensity and creamy consistency of Tuscany's world famous reds. Ripe fruit, cherry and exotic spice would pair with steak, lamb or oven-roasted pasta.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The nose is shy but eventually offers suggestions of black cherry, underbrush, grilled herb and a balsamic note.

Beyond that, it offers good tannins and fine acidity. There isn't much complexity or layering, but it sure is tasty.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A good pick for radicchio risotto or roasted chicory, this is a floral and delicate Barolo that would pair well with a sweet and sour food theme.

It has a lean, somewhat shallow mouthfeel with a drying mineral finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A warm, opulent wine from the southernmost Grand Cru of Alsace. It has richness, ripe peach and pear fruits, a hint of maturity bringing out spice. There's a tang of orange giving freshness to this serious, complex wine. Drink now and until 2020\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very concentrated wine, almost too much in its overpowering richness. Peaches and crisper pears play with the spice, perfume and intense acidity. At the end, pepper shows the alcohol.

With a dry, puckering mouthfeel, it's boldly ripe and brawny, showing persistent toasty oak scents.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A mature nose of cornbread and oxidized fruits suggests a wine older than this. A white blend, it features a multitude of grapes led by Viura. On the palate, acidity is the key ingredient, while a mix of oxidized apple, melon and corn flavors runs long on the finish. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This well-made full-bodied wine exudes a juicy core of red currant, cranberry and vanilla as a persistence of tannin provides power and wooded support. Oak and cedar play nicely together and add a wealth of savory concentration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from vines close to the chateau of Santenay, this is a tight, mineral wine.

Forest-driven flavors power the palate, where firm but forgiving tannins present black cherry and dark chocolate shavings.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Unbelievably rich and decadent, this tastes of honey drizzled over crushed ripe pineapples, guavas and pears. Added hints of buttered toast, vanilla bean, caramel and sweet cream come with scads of savory pie spices.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dusty tannins and notes of dried herbs give this vigorous young Cabernet a mark of immaturity that strongly suggests time in the cellar, despite flashy blackberry and black currant flavors.

Best after 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made from 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Cabernet Franc, it has every hallmark of a young Napa Valley Bordeaux blend.

The acidity, sweet black plum jelly, both give a warm, ripe character to the wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big-time tannins make this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties tight in character. Underneath the astringency are intense flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that are liberally oaked. Dry and refined, the wine will develop bottle complexity after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a fine Syrah from a producer with a long history of success with the Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne variety. It's inky and dark in color with a palate that's tannic and dry, with long, deep, spicy flavors of blackberries, grilled meat, black pepper and toasty oak. It will provide good drinking with grilled meats and stews over the next two years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Give this 100% Cabernet just a little more time in the cellar. Even at six-plus years of age, its tannins are hard, although the primary blackberry fruit flavors are beginning to dry out and become earthy.

Very balanced and complex. The tannins are soft enough to drink it tonight, but it can also age, if you want.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This prestige cuvee honors Guy Devaux, who founded the California winery, and takes the familiar, user-friendly house style to an unprecedented level of intensity. The concentrated, beguiling nose suggests cask-conditioned ale and freshly baked bread. The wine fills every corner of the palate with rich, seductively layered flavors. The finish says California, not Champagne, with its tart fruit and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and full-bodied, this opens with aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, leather toast, licorice and menthol.

The firm palate offers dried black cherry, pomegranate mocha and vanilla alongside tightly packed tannins that leave a tongue-drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is rather shy and just hints at citrus freshness. The palate, however, fizzes with expressive lively lemon notes which are presented on a light, fruity, inherently fresh and dry body. This is easy and totally refreshing and finishes on a lovely lemon note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Extraordinarily high alcohol is the defining reality of this wine. It gives it a burn in the mouth, like cognac, only without the richness. The currant and spice flavors are nicely dry, but that high alcohol accentuates the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crushed cloves, allspice and nutmeg are sprinkled across a ripe olallieberry base on this wine from a vineyard owned by the founder of Rabbit Ridge. It's thick and dense on the palate, perhaps too much so for some, with dried cherries, cranberries, lots of spice and even some tar elements.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sheer lusciousness marks this 100% Cabernet. It was grown on the estate vineyard in Calistoga, and shows great ripeness even in this cool vintage.

Drink from 2018 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of grapes from St. Helena and Coombsville, this is a balanced combination of warm, ripe fruit and cool-climate acidity. The flavors are ripe with black currants and new French oak. It's already throwing sediment, but it should reward additional time in the cellar. Give it until at least 2017, although it could still be rocking and rolling in 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very wound-up aromas of dried and dark red berries and asphalt show on the nose of this bottling from Temecula, another sign that Italian varieties can thrive in the warmer climate.

This bottling honors its pedigree as California's first classic Cabernet.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Earthy, meaty and spicy-it's what Napa Cabernet is supposed to be. Perfectly balanced, smooth and totally correct, it has cherry and chocolate in spades and lots of grip. In the end it's all about class and performance.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Full-priced, full-bodied, and the full complement of just about all you want in a Rutherford Cab.

The gang at BV sure know how to craft Cabernet.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Deep berry, cinnamon, briar and mint aromas. Firm, even backwards, it is trim and elegant, yet solid.

Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A proprietary blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc, 3% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot, Zephyr is thick and rich.

This wine uses the very local Grolleau, grown biodynamically. Unusually this is a red wine (Grolleau is normally found in ros\\u00c3\\u00a9). The wine is lightly stalky with red-currant fruit and intense acidity. It is light in texture but rich in complexity, and has some aging potential. Drink now, but better from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Unusually, this premier cru vineyard produces both red and white wines, both of which are made by this domaine.

The palate comes in with pear-fruited generosity and an almost oily mouthfeel that speaks of the power of this concentrated wine. There is a pleasant edge of pithy bitterness that acts as a counterpoint to the inherent richness and ripeness of the fruit alongside fresh acidity.

Spice and toast notes merge with the yellow fruits and structured nervosity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a floral wine that combines structure, firm acidity and intensely ripe fruit. Flavors of green fruit, citrus, toast and some smoke give complexity to this concentrated, full-bodied effort.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A beautifully perfumed wine from one of Volnay's top vineyards, this delights with its aromatic red fruits, ripe tannins and balancing acids. It is still settling down and will certainly round out over the next years when its more sumptuous side will come forward.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a taut wine, touched by yeast and warmed by ripe yellow fruit. Flavors of melon and spice from the new wood give it an open feel. It's ripe, already rounded and full bodied.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a structured wine with rich, concentrated fruits. It has a strong mineral content along with a tense texture. Tropical fruit flavors come through on the rich, opulent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The toasted oak aromas are still evident on the nose, so give this a few more years to unwind before opening. With patience, you'll be rewarded with tones of bright fruit, spice, licorice, molasses, brown sugar and tobacco. There's a hint of red apple on the finish, rendering it fresh and zesty.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This expression is beautifully integrated and balanced, with notes of forest fruit and cassis that are set against touches of tar, licorice, brown sugar and cola. The lush and opulent finish delivers an impressive load of dark chocolate and exotic spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This delivers inky dark, brooding aromas of black fruit, dark spice, molasses, resin, tar and cured meat. The mouthfeel is soft and chewy, with a sticky mocha flavor and a spicy endnote of barbecue spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This special vineyard-designate delivers savory notes of cured meat, smoked bacon, barbecued herbs and candied berries. The intensity and overall complexity is impressive, and so is the richness and persistency of the mouthfeel. It ends with a touch of crispness and a bitter cherry accent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Remo Farina makes a style of Amarone that will appeal to those who are true fans of this distinctive category of Italian reds. This is big, bold and not bashful by any stretch. It offers masculine tones of warm leather, cured meat, smoked bacon, ripe fruit and blackberry preserves. The finish is tightly loaded with a fresh tobacco flavor.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: On first sniff you may want to head for the hills; Maturana is a funky smelling grape with strong herbaceous notes. And while that character never subsides, this smells better with time. Flavors of mint, bell pepper and herbal berry fruits finish round, long and saucy. Only 160 cases of this unusual wine were made.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A strong, bold young wine, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants. It's hard in tannins now, and the oak hasn't been integrated even though the wine is nearing the five year mark. Somehow, it doesn't seem like a longterm ager, but it will benefit from a couple years in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark and heavy for a Pinot Noir, although it's certainly well made and delicious. Floods the mouth with cherry and raspberry pie-filling fruit, and the smoky, caramelized oak has a granola sweetness. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and creamy, this has alluring aromas of ripe orchard fruit, toasted bread crust and a whiff of honey. The smooth palate doles out mature yellow apple, candied nectarine zest and toasted hazelnut framed in fresh acidity and an elegant mousse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The blackberry fruit is so powerful and rich, it punches right through this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend. It's still tough in tannins, however, giving it a harshly astringent mouthfeel. It would be a shame to drink it too young, so give it until 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of tough, old-fashioned tannins on this pugnacious young Cabernet. While it has a good core of blackberries and currants, it's pretty brutal on the palate. Hard to tell if the fruit will outlast the astringency. Try after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With sharp acidity and pungent black currant, plum and raisin flavors, this muscular Cabernet is probably best to drink now. It's an interesting wine, with a spicy, tannic finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is soft with some nice layers, and delicious in blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors that finish dry, with a scour of sweet tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage of Madre features pretty aromas, inspired by fruit and flower-based elements. The wine boasts a deep ruby color and full concentration in the mouth. The finish is long and satisfying.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: You'll recognize this Sangiovese immediately thanks to pristine notes of blue flowers, chalky soil, sage and Mediterranean herbs. It has a thinner, delicate texture in the mouth but ends with bright, vibrant crispness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The emphasis here is on elegance and the wine delivers a lighter mouthfeel with delicate layers of fresh berry, Mediterranean herbs, oregano and rosemary. There's nice fullness in the mouth, polished tannins and an overall delicate style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Maremma is a paradise for horseback riders and hunters and there's something about this juicy red that makes you crave a hearty game dish by an open hearth. Its aromas are very mature and include cracked white pepper, ripe blackberry, and smoked meat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, rich and painted in broad brush strokes, San Martino is a meaty, fleshy wine you can sink your teeth into. It offers clean notes of cherry candy, licorice and resin and follows through with gritty texture and crisp notes of bright fruit on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Scrio boasts chunky aromas of clove, milk chocolate, coconut and pulsing blueberry. You can definitely identify the hot vintage in the wine's complex DNA although it isn't a big issue in terms of quality. The mouthfeel is polished and firm and the wine's long finish is amazing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle, nuanced aromas of ash, black pepper, crushed flowers and mineral are followed by a lithe, restrained palate mixing fruit and savory flavors. It shows a very pretty sense of balance and tension.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas pop with notes of wet gravel, mineral, funk, olive tapenade and high-toned flowers. The flavors are palate coating yet light and restrained, with generous savory and umami flavors that draw out on the finish. It has a very pretty sense of texture and precision\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094all about elegance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas are generous, with notes of potpourri, dried herbs and black pepper. The palate is full of citrus and savory flavors that show depth and intensity along with restraint. Savory notes persist on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is a blend of fruit from six different vineyards across the valley. Alluring aromas of cassis, earth, spice, vanilla and flowers are followed by a structured palate, with enough tannic heft to reward time in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The premier cru is right in the heart of the appellation, close to the village. This wine, with its intense fruits and strongly textured character, is still trying out its structure and density. The potential is there with apricot and apple fruits waiting to come thorough the tight structure. Drink this fine wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, rose petal, tilled soil, aromatic herb, leather and a whiff of game are just some of the aromas you'll find on this intense, full-bodied wine. The palate is still tight, showing wild cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, baking spice and tobacco alongside firm tannins that need time to unwind. It already has depth but will develop even more complexity over the next decade and more. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from old vines, this is a beautiful wine. It has great structure, minerality and concentration along with a full-bodied richness that is developing well. Combined with the ripe yellow fruits, they give an opulent wine that will age for several years. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Doesn't say so on the label, but this is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, from the Atlas Peak area. Very dry and tannic, with an astringent lockdown, it's functionally undrinkable now, but it does show the intensity of this mountainous region for Cabernet, with explosive blackberry, blueberry and black currant flavors. All indications are that it's an ager. Hold until 2015, at the very least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: So upfront in spectacularly ripe raspberry, cherry and mocha flavors, it's hard to keep from draining the bottle now. This shows the classic tannins of Stags Leap, soft and sweet but potent. Drink it now and enjoy for sheer opulence, but you might be missing out on something really special around 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is a best-of-barrels selection from Summers' various Cabs throughout Napa Valley. It's unquestionably a big wine, densely packed with blackberry, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also very young. The tannins pack a real punch. New oak, to the tune of 100%, is apparent in the buttered toast richness. Don't drink it now, good as it is. Give it until 2014, and it will develop long beyond that.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An intense, mineral-driven wine, tasting of the limestone soil as well as very ripe fruit. Great acidity keeps the richness in line, toast offering sweetness. The wine is full-bodied, the flavors going right through to the apple-skin-textured core.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Go ahead, knock this wine for high alcohol, if you want. It's still one of the best blends of its kind in California. It oozes blackberry and blueberry jam, melted dark chocolate, bacon, anise and pepper flavors that are extraordinarily rich. Drink it soon for maximum freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the ultimate expressions of Etna, San Lorenzo is an elegant, determined and sophisticated wine with a steady stream of delicate aromas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094wild berry, crushed granite, smoke and cola\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094that build in momentum and evolve beautifully over time. The mouthfeel is firm and structured, with polished tannins and a bright berry endnote.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A taut, steely, very mineral wine, showing a tense, textured character. Fruit flavors run from grapefruit to peach, with a delicious tang of zest along the way. With its acidity and structure, this is a wine for long-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: So sweet and strong in jammy blackberry fruit, this young Cabernet is hardly drinkable now. The vineyard is in the Oak Knoll District, and the wine shows the big tannins and fine acidity of this cooler part of Napa Valley. An obvious cellar candidate, it needs 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years of bottle age to begin to mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a fleshy Cabernet, with meaty, olive notes to the blackberries and black currants. It's nicely dry and tannic, the kind of Cab that needs a rich steak to tame the astringency. Should develop over the next 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This smooth and elegant Priorat offers a fine mix of red fruit, tobacco, spice and vanilla on the bouquet. It feels fresh and crisp in the mouth, with ample body and solid flavors of licorice, toast and black fruits. Things darken up on the finish, where molasses, pepper and spice notes run out for a good, long time. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A dramatic Cabernet that immediately impresses for power and voluptuous texture. Dazzles with waves of blackberries, cassis and chocolate, wrapped into the smoothest tannins you can imagine. Winemaker Thomas Rivers Brown made this lovely 100% Cabernet from fruit grown in a warmer region of the Vaca Mountains. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This tiny production blend surely is made in the modern cult style. Its tannins are soft and sexy, its flavors deep and delicious with milk chocolate, blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and buttery toast. The only thing it lacks is subtlety, but it does deserve its score for sheer Napa power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of people will like this wine, but purists will object to the sugary, almost Porty sweetness. It's undeniably rich and focused in cherries, blackberries, raspberries and vanilla-chocolate truffle, with a delicious edge of smoky, vanilla-accented oak. But it's not a dry wine, more like something you'd sip at a cocktail party.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At five years, this Bordeaux blend is ruggedly dry and firmly tannic, with a baked or cooked edge to the blackberries. It's not very flattering now, but there's a slim chance it could soften and sweeten with age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine tastes like it was treated to the most modern winemaking techniques designed for maximum extraction. It's soft and gentle, with jammy, pie-filling flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants and black raspberries.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a great Cabernet, blended with a drop of Petit Verdot. It shows the intensity of mountain fruit, with incredibly concentrated black currant and cassis flavors, with superb tannins. Few Cabernets have shown this degree of ageability. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intensely fruity on the nose, with spicy flavors that follow and expand across the palate. This has excellent grip and depth, along with balancing acidity and structure. Plum, kirsch and concentrated cherry flavors pop out. It's a wine of refined power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage marks a welcome return of Viognier to the otherwise all-red Cayuse portfolio. It's an immaculate, elegant, complex wine, redolent of wet stone, dried herbs (thyme, rosemary), jicama, cucumber, lime, grapefruit, melon and more. It is clear and clean, precise and focused. It does not push the ripeness, or overshoot the cool vintage, and never sacrifices complexity. Fermented and aged in a concrete egg, it's seen no oak at all.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brandied berry, coconut and marzipan aromas are ripe and heady for CVNE, but super inviting. In the mouth, this is structured and firm, with plenty of acidic cut and snap. Coconut and balsamic berry are the lead flavors, while the finish is herbal and shows a pinch of saltiness along with a dry feel. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: White truffle, dark chocolate, ripe plum and blue flowers are some of the aromas you'll find in this impressive Merlot. The powerful, extracted palate doles out fleshy blackberry, black cherry, clove, tobacco, licorice and cured meat. Velvety tannins wrap around the bold flavors, providing support and a smooth texture. You'll also detect the warmth of evident alcohol, which gives it a one-dimensional finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This blend combines 64% Merlot with 34% Cabernet Franc and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon to nice effect, offering cranberry and red, juicy plum around softly cradled tannins and well-resolved oak. Juicy, structured and fully balanced, the finish sparks elements of leather with tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose on this jet-black wine by vintner Carl Bowker is intoxicatingly appealing, with aromas of fresh blackberry jam, plum jelly, black pepper, black cardamom and allspice. It's rich and soft once sipped, unleashing an array of mission figs, black plums and black cherries, and gaining complexity thanks to graphite, black licorice, fudge and expresso.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of blue flowers, black-skinned fruit and whiffs of mocha lead the nose on this structured Sangiovese. The full-bodied palate delivers mature plum, fleshy black cherry, clove and Mediterranean herb alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a note of mint chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe, wood-aged wine that shows the richer side of Meursault. It's generous with ripe yellow fruits, but balanced and complemented by crisp acidity and hints of toastiness. A fine wine with impeccable structure, it will age well, so drink from 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An elegant wine that is given weight by its rich black fruits and style by the balance between tannins and acidity. There is a fresh character to this bright and fruity wine at this stage. Give it 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years and it will begin to develop secondary aromas. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: French philosopher and writer Charles-Louis de Montesquieu once lived at the moated Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau de la Br\\u00c3\\u00a8de, hence the name of this wine. It is a ripe, finely perfumed wine, with new wood and eucalyptus aromas, rich red fruits and a soft, open series of tannins. It is almost ready to drink, but the chocolate edge suggests it should be kept until 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brut Milled\\u00c3\\u00ac is an elegant sparkling wine made from Chardonnay. It offers aromas of yellow spring flowers and crisp zesty citrus flavors. This has nice length, and finishes on an almond note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel. Zin provides the fuel to power the wine, while Cab lends elegance and structure. The flavors are a composite of both grapes, explosive in blackberries, currants, mocha, pepper and charcuterie.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The pedigree of the vineyard shows in this Cab. It's as intensely ripe as Cabernet gets, with a massive core of blackberry jam, cassis liqueur and chocolate, enriched with sweet new oak. But it's so balanced in tannins and acidity that it never feels over-the-top. The alcohol is quite high, though, which may limit ageability.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A darkly tannic wine, showing a dry side of Pinot Noir but still offering some good berry fruits and raspberry sweetness. The acidity needs to soften, though.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: So soft and sweet in fruity, chocolaty richness, it's almost like a Port, without the fortification, although the alcohol is a high 15.5%. The tastes are of melted chocolate and cherry pie filling, spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The cool weather of the Sonoma Coast has made for an acidic, somewhat minty wine. It has some good flavors of cherries, and is elegantly structured and bone dry, but may not have the stuffing for the cellar, so drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 89% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11% Merlot, this wine has subtle baking spice and a velvety texture of soft, red fruit. With the barest minimum of grip on the back palate, it's ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Give this Pinot two or three years in the cellar, and it could go a bit longer than that. In youth, it's tight in acidity, and the sweet oak and raspberry fruit flavors haven't come together yet. It shows a delightful silkiness and deeper complexities of mushrooms.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: White pepper and a floral nose pique interest right away in this wine. A relatively light-bodied expression of the grape, it's soft in body and texture that persists in flavors of cinnamon stick.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vines in deep red-iron soil on this tiny biodynamic family parcel (1.3 acres) are just coming into their own. This ripe wine balances rich yellow fruit with a tight shot of acidity and citrus. Fresh and crisp with touches of spice and butter., it is ready to drink.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Toast, espresso, oak and grilled herb aromas lead the nose while the palate offers dried black cherry, raw cranberry, orange zest and oak. Raspy tannins leave a bracing, drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, powerful wine, in the Pride style. It's massively constructed, with concentrated blackberry jam and currant flavors. The drawback is a green, vegetal streak that prevents meaningful aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Solare does a very good job of dosing out its many aromatic nuances over a long stretch of time. Layer after layer, you'll get red fruit, soy sauce, spice, cola and licorice. The blend is 80-20 Sangiovese-Malvasia Nera. It's ready to drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A perfect collaboration between two celebrated Tuscan estates, this plush wine is stacked tall with pretty aromas of cola, sweet spice, root beer, clove, toast and forest fruit. There's harmony and elegance here and the wine takes on marvelous shape in the mouth where it builds in intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a hit from Tuscany that boasts rich concentration and thick layers of fruit, spice, cola, molasses and almond. The color is gorgeous and so is the mouthfeel that really comes alive thanks to the wine's delicate balance between fruit and tonic freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this is a compelling and exciting expression of territory. The Tassinaia hill produces a balanced wine with black fruit and some herbal notes backed by spice, toast and a long satisfying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an expressive and lively blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese that boasts dark, meaty concentration, an inky black appearance and big toasted notes of roasted nut, cedar, leather and spice. It is distinguished by polished tannins and outstanding intensity on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percentages of Alicante and Petit Verdot that render a soapy, herbal nose with accents of root beer, exotic spice, lavender potpourri and green pepper corn. It is very well balanced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is modern and plush, ripe and chewy with all kinds of playful renderings of chocolate fudge, coffee and sweet spice in between. Deep fruit renderings peel off layer after layer giving way to solid structure and a polished, dusty finish. Drink after 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is far and away the best Mirto of all time. It's ripe and brawny, with bacon and black-fruit aromas that put it squarely into the Nuevo Classic mold. In the mouth, licorice and nutmeg flavors give character to smooth blackberry and dark plum flavors, while the finish is cushioned, herbal and long. Immediately appealing but with five to ten years of aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Romitorio di Santedame is Ruffino's top wine. It is a big, plump wine and is almost too thick and powerful in places, making it well suited to succulent cuts of red meat. But it's hard not to love its extraction, sophisticated mouthfeel and blockbuster tannins. Drink after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nambrot features inviting aromas of sweet cherry, vanilla bean and espresso grinds. The wine is sweet and succulent in the mouth with blueberry flavors and a long, spicy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A concentrated, inky black wine with woodshop tones that are still very evident.

Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cab offers big blackberry aromas, brown sugar, dark concentration and a brooding disposition. It's plush and modern, and a true bruiser, with firm tannins and opulent flavors of toast and plum. Ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This expression of Petit Verdot from Maremma in southern Tuscany boasts thick concentration and lively aromas of prune, plum, black fruit, root beer, peppercorn and licorice. It's still raw in the mouth and needs time; drink after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sangiovese is enhanced with 15% Malvasia Nera in this modern, rich wine. It offers sweet cherry renderings backed by blueberry, milk chocolate and molasses. Ripe and chewy in the mouth, the wine's juicy succulence calls out for lamb, beef or game meat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smelling this wine is like entering a spice box: Saffron, cumin, cardamom and cinnamon all put in minute appearances. But the real protagonist is the wood, which still needs a few years to integrate, and the plump chocolate-covered cherries you get in the mouth. It's a thickly extracted wine with tight tannins: Drink after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coronato is a robust, modern super Tuscan only produced for export markets. Indeed, you can sense a New World appeal within its rich, succulent fabric thanks to penetrating notes of coffee, espresso, tar, aniseed, chocolate and bursting cherry.

With great fruit allied to an opulent texture, it is both spicy and full of tropical fruit flavors. At the moment, it is just bursting with fruit and will need time to calm down, so wait to drink until 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There have been 19 (dix-neuf) generations of Mellots making wine in Sancerre; at least one of them in each generation has been named Alphonse. This wine celebrates the history and the great quality of the family's wines today. It is richly endowed with both the beautifully ripe fruit and with a sophisticated acidity and texture. Drink this very fine wine now, although, like the Mellots, it will also age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's rose petal, herb, dark spice and woodland berry aromas slowly take shape, along with a whiff of new leather. The full-bodied, energetic palate delivers juicy red cherry, cranberry, clove, cinnamon and orange peel flavors while youthfully austere tannins and vibrant acidity provide the framework.

Drink after 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker James MacPhail continues to refine his solo project with this Annapolis-sourced effort, a smooth layered expression of baked strawberry and rose petal herbaceousness. Lingering fruitiness makes it lovely to enjoy, as the oak remains a background player in full support of the succulence and ripe power. Still young, it should continue to open further over time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Maybe the friendliest Hirsch bottling, this wine has wonderful complexity, medium body and a broad supple texture that make it a pleasure to taste. It has spicy lightly earthy aromas, plenty of raspberry, red cherry and rhubarb for fruit flavors, and a good sense of layering on the palate, followed by a long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with delicate aromas suggesting mocha, black-skinned berry and vanilla. The dense palate delivers black currant jam, clove and tobacco alongside taut tannins. Enjoy through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Everything about this Cabernet argues for cellaring. With a little Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it's enormously complex, with fruit flavors that range from blackberries and cherries to black currants. There's also a pleasant herbaceousness that suggests sweet green peas. The tannins are significant, so let it develop bottle complexity until 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe, succulent red cherries and currants are accented with sweet toasty oak and wrapped into smooth, but thick, tannins in this Cab Franc. There's a wonderful sweet-pea herbaceousness that adds interest. This lip-smackingly tasty wine, which is moderate in alcohol, should develop bottle nuances over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Unctuous texture is the telltale sign of quality  in a rich, sweet, botrytized wine. This wine has traded the spice of a Gewurztraminer with a palate full of honey and delicate lemon acidity. It is a fine, complex wine that is developing well. Drink until 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bone dry and pretty tannic at the age of four-plus years, this Merlot has interesting flavors of cherries, red currants, Dr. Pepper cola and sweet, smoky oak.

The acidity is firm and clean. Feels juvenile, with a jamminess that a few years in the cellar should resolve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty good Cabernet, dry and very tannic, and rich in black currants and oak. It's made in the modern style, and not likely to age, so drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With just a touch of Merlot in the blend, this juicy, big-boned red tastes of tar, blackberry and cedar, with a suggestion of mossy wood.

You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol that throws the finish off balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend is proprietors Claire and Gonzague Lurton's foray into California fruit: the two of them together owner several estates in Bordeaux. Their estate vineyard site, still in replanting mode, sits atop a compelling knoll atop Chalk Hill.

Almost sweet, a fruit bomb. Doesn't seem likely to age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very concentrated and closed up, like a coil. The intense green fruit is followed by plum skins. Crispness, dry but fresh, comes alongside a powerful explosion of flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: We all wonder if those cult Cabs will age, but there's no doubt that this is a cellar guarantee. Cathy Corison makes her Cabs less ripe than many others, so the alcohol is lower and the acids and tannins are harder and drier. That's in youth.

Layered without being overly concentrated, it's made and owned by Chris Pittenger, who also makes Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne-inspired wines for Skinner Vineyards in El Dorado County.

Smooth but sturdy tannins and a long finish seal the deal.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Powerpacked stuff, no ifs, ands or buts. But it's also a tannic heavyweight with a clamp-down palate that feels a bit like chewing on bolts. Starting aromas of raisin, char and black olive are brooding and mulchy, while the main act is dark, with coffee and cassis. Better flavors than feel; however, time could tame the beast.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this opens with intense aromas of thyme, sage, citrus peel and toasted walnut.

Puckering in tannin, it offers faint mint and high-toned black cherry, the finish ripe and vanilla-sweet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry juice, licorice, grape seed and dried ginger show on the nose of this jammy, spicy blend of 31% Merlot, 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Cabernet Franc, 16% Petit Verdot and 9% Malbec. It's rich in dark fruits at first, then tightens on clean and wound-up tannins, with intense pepper and rounded caramel toward the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This expresses pretty Nebbiolo aromas of violet, saddle leather, truffle and red berry.

A mineral-textured wine, it's crisp now and will likely round out to bring out the ripeness. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Daou brothers break a bit from their polished house style to dive into gamy wonders in this blend of 80% Petite Sirah, 12% Tannat and 8% Tempranillo, with a nose that shows burned tire, bacon fat, underripe plums and freshly paved street. Crushed black pepper, charred beef and animal-hide funkiness converge on the palate. It's a great counterpoint to the winery's usual suavity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Richly oaked aromas of burnt wood, caramel and sawmill compete with jammy blackberry and cassis notes. A rugged, drawing palate is fiercely tannic and dry. Blackberry, burnt oak and coffee flavors dry out quickly on the finish, leaving simmering toasty mint. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A smoky spicy wine that is full of berry fruits and with some toasty wood-aging flavors. With its tannic structure it will need to age, although already the bright berry fruits are generous and ripe.

The combination is already rich, but holds good potential as well.

It comes from one of the top premier-cru vineyards in the appellation, well situated halfway up the slope, facing east. The wine will develop slowly as the ripe fruit comes through the structure. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the highest point in the Meursault vineyards, this wine is crisp and cool. It has a tight, bright character that is driven by the steely, mineral texture. The grapefruit flavors go with the riper apple and pear roundness to give a wine that will take a little time to develop. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find alluring scents of black-skinned berry, baking spice, violet, a hint of leather and a balsamic note on this well-structured red.

It's already approachable but also has great mid-term aging potential. Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fragrant blue flower, ripe wild berry, a whiff of exotic spice and a whisper of French oak come together in the glass. On the firm palate, notes of baking spice and pipe tobacco accent a core of dried black cherry. Close-grained tannins provide the polished framework. It's already rather accessible but will offer fine drinking for several years or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Every producer seems to own, or have access to, a small part of Clos de Vougeot even if quantities produced are tiny.

Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine offers pure fruit flavors of crisp lemon, ripe apricots and apples, all nourished by carefully judged wood that gives a touch of toast. A strong mineral element gives the wine tight texture. As it develops, this will become a well-balanced wine. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heaps of earthy compost provide seductive intrigue to the opening of this wine. It continues satisfactorily on the palate, a piquant expression of black cherry, black tea and lingering acidity wrapped in a medium, softly layered body.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bone-dry wine is rather severe in tannins. It feels elegant, but lacks immediate reward, with cherry, currant and tobacco flavors that disappear into a cloak of astringency. Could develop after 2011, but no guarantees.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A firm and tannic wine initially, but then it opens out with such sweet, generous fruits and flavors of strawberries and pepper. The texture is dense, a vertical pile of ripe tannins and richness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A big bruiser of a wine. It is easy to love the firm, complex structure allied with beautifully ripe, sweet fruit flavors. The wine is rich and powerful, but there are so many things going on here, from the intense tannins to the smoky black finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The largest of the premier crus of Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e can make complete wines, as in this example. It has ripe fruit, touched with juiciness, but it is the enveloping firm and full structure that gives the wine its special character. It has a range of sweet fruit flavors, allied to dark tannins, suggesting aging potential.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Classic Pommard, a big, firm, tannic wine that is foursquare and dominating. It broods with its dense structure and concentration. The fruits are solid, with plum skins, red berries and bursts of acidity. All this adds up to a wine that needs to age. Aim for five years before drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is rich, sweet, extravagant and, finally, elegant. Its ripe fruit flavors, red plums, sweet strawberries and smoky acidity all work together. The wine shows considerable concentration, but never loses sight of freshness. Age for another five years at least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Initially round, this develops a strong minerality, with a texture that is firm and dominating ripe fruit. There is definite austerity here. The wine is at present firm and tough, and needs several years to open up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A structured, relatively cool Volnay, dominated more by ripe tannins than by fruit. The fruit that is there is fresh, layered with acidity, juicy in texture, with cranberry and black plum skin flavors. The finish suggests red berries with its firmness. The wine demands at least five years' aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautifully perfumed wine, all herbs and smokiness. The palate sings the same tune, a rich, sensuous one, laced with more somber notes of dark, dry tannins. At the end of the day, this is already a delicious wine, but one that will really improve over 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Corton is the largest grand cru in Burgundy (all of 240 acres) and its style can vary widely. Bouchard has gone for a relatively soft style, emphasizing fruits, raspberry, myrtle and black currants, topped with acidity. It is a light, delicious wine, but probably not for aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A dense, almost heavy wine, with smoky, licorice flavors that dominate the fruit. It is firm, big, solid, the sort of wine that demands attention with its concentration and powered structure. It may need time for aging, but already the power and weight are there.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The richness of the fruit from Caillerets is so evident in this scrumptious wine. With its big, bold black fruits, it has sweetness, a soft, generous texture and evocative perfumes. It is so delicious and ready to drink now, that even the acidity that shows through has a hard time reminding us that this wine should age as well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, toasted hazelnut and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The tightly wound palate is still rather closed and on the lean side in terms of fruit richness, but slowly reveals sour cherry, licorice and a note of ground pepper. A tannic backbone provides structure.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toasted oak, espresso and exotic spice follow through to the firm palate along with star anise and notes of dried cherry. Bracing, close-grained tannins leave an extremely astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in small quantities, this wine opens in a decadence of gingerbread and graham cracker aromas before a medium-bodied texture supports a supple ripeness of green apple, melon and pear.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Even in a fruity year, Pommard lives up to its reputation for firm tannins. This wine will have delicious ripe black fruits, although not just yet. The structure and the dark tannins are up front, leaving tantalizing hints of the richness to come. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Baking spice, blue flower, exotic spice and a hint of game slowly emerge on this. The approachable palate offers ripe black cherry, fig, cinnamon and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside rounded tannins. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of leather, stewed prune, underbrush and a whiff of game lead the nose.

Firm tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From vines in the north of the Nuits Saint-Georges, close to Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e, this is a structured wine. It has ripe berry fruits and acidity that are still developing through the firm, dry tannins. The wine is still young and needs to age, so drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tingling acidity keeps this wine fresh. It is an impressive Cab, blended with small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot, that's aged in French oak. Lively, the oak is soft and approachable, making room for the bright notions of dark cherry, cassis and vanilla that linger on the generous finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy tobacco, clove and black currant accent plush layers of integrated oak and rounded, persistent tannin in this Bordeaux-style blend. Full bodied and quite ripe, it's a nice showcase for Napa Valley fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas are light, with mineral, crushed flowers, savory notes, smoked meat, black pepper and embers. The palate is restrained and pretty in style, showing a sense of balance that runs from head to tail, with plenty of length on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Syrah (80%), Cabernet Sauvignon (14%) and Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, this opens with aromas of wet gravel, herb, smoke, funk, nori and black olive that are followed by plentiful, soft, generous savory flavors that bring a lot of intensity and appeal. The finish lingers.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Chappellet winemaker Phillip Corallo-Titus helps make this wine, a blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec.

It's rich and velvety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of blue flower, tilled soil, and perfumed berries waft from the glass of this full-bodied Rosso. The smooth palate delivers succulent black cherry accented with sweet baking spices alongside supple tannins. Enjoy it now to capture the juicy fruit flavors.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This elegant Rosso opens with an intense and alluring fragrance of rose, blue flower and crushed red berries. The palate is more evolved than the fresh aromas suggest, delivering ripe black raspberry and crushed red cherry lightly accented with cinnamon-spice. A note of orange zest marks the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vespera combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Petite Sirah from two of the winery's signature vineyards, Grigsby and Collinetta, into an explosion of chocolate, mint and intense tannins. A tropical layer lurks on the back palate, making the wine an intriguing quaff.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Exotic, smoky aromas of blue fruits and Middle Eastern spices are proprietary to this wine. The mouthfeel is juicy but also earthy, while flavors of tobacco, mint, herbs and plum finish mellow and elegant. Although 2007 was not a good vintage in Rioja, this is a success; drink through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky in leathery barrel flavor, this soft Cabernet Franc comes with layers of herb and red currant that are modest in alcohol and tannins. Those flavors will be piqued when paired with chicken pot pie or a pizza topped in bell pepper and olive.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From an estate vineyard and given very little oak, this white sings in Key-lime pie and orange blossom, a heady, floral liquid invitation that gives way to unctuous texture and medium weight. Chalky somewhat on the finish, it should continue to integrate over time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of crushed rose, red berry, wild mint, menthol and a hint of oak come together. The linear, focused palate offers raw red cherry, strawberry, white pepper, licorice and chopped sage accompanied by tightly knit, close-grained tannins and bright acidity. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine leads with tire rubber, bacon, forest floor, juniper and blackberry aromas, requiring as much air or time as you can give. In the mouth, it's hard, tannic and almost astringent. A mix of oak and herb-laced black fruit flavors finishes long, with plenty of energy and power in reserve.

Enjoy 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Slight yeasty funk still hangs over the nose. The palate immediately comes in with driven force and incredible energy.

Cranberry, pomegranate and orange flavors provide complexity, complemented by black tea and forest floor notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Restrained notes of honeyed richness rise from the glass. The ripe peach scent has floral overtones. The palate has a fluid, almost oily feel but is dry. A wonderfully fine phenolic edge helps to provide structure to this evolving Gewurztraminer, as do aromatic notes of orange zest. The harmonious balance of body and weight, of concentration and elegance on this dry wine are exemplary. The finish is long and elegant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A 100% varietal wine with layers of leather and bacon at the core, this full-bodied bottling is otherwise soft and juicy in red and black fruit. Overlaying it all is a smoky quality that overbears at times, but will pair well with the right foods.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mocha, espresso, coconut, ripe black-skinned fruit and new wood lead the nose on this hearty blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 25% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The thickly concentrated palate offers up dried black cherry, roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and vanilla alongside astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fragrant Barolo has lovely floral and underbrush aromas and a restrained palate showing cherry and spice. It's tightly tannic and very nervous, needing more time to soften up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This riserva from one of Barolo's most celebrated vineyards doesn't disappoint, even in the scorching 2007 vintage. It delivers succulent black cherry, herb and spearmint sensations along with brooding tannins and just enough freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy black cherry and strawberry flirt with this vineyard-designate's sultry and dense earthiness, combining two sides of the equation with a deft hand. Tea, sage and robust tannins give it depth and breadth across the palate, as tingling acidity keeps it fresh.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Youthfully wound up, this wine celebrates the winery's founding in 1977. A waft of nutty marzipan opens the gate to a wonderland of lemon, apple, pear and pineapple, the acidity supportive in lending a refreshing backbeat to the fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is soft and subdued, inviting in its full-bodied embrace of vanilla. With all five red Bordeaux varieties involved, it makes an impact, showcasing rich red berry, cassis and cherry, while a dusting of clove spice finds length on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Although this wine is tight with tannins and wood aging, it shows the softer side of the appellation with its ripe red berry fruit. Needing more time in bottle to deliver the opulence of its fine Premier Cru vineyard, it will be best from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stalky aromas suggest weedy underbrush and celery, with whiffs of salted appetizers and sweat.

The mouthfeel is divinely rich and supple.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The cool 2010 vintage has allowed Roadhouse to express its focused and elegant approach to Pinot Noir with great success. Black Label is a small-production barrel selection. Silky and delicate in the mouth, it features dramatically layered flavors: cola, exotic spice, sweet red cherry and ripe raspberry. It's a little hot on the finish, which limits its score.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Late-harvest Vermentino makes for an interesting dessert wine that both sweet and fresh.

At the moment, ripe yellow-fruit flavors are submerged beneath this onslaught of wood, but it should integrate better, so give it until 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of cellar floor, roasted herb, anise and toast come together on this. The straightforward palate offers cherry marinated in spirits and licorice while a note of powdered sage gives it a bitter finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak, espresso and toast aromas take center stage and follow through to the tightly wound palate along with a hint of butterscotch, coconut and the barest hint of dried cherry. It possesses structure but lacks the fruit richness to stand up to the assertive tannins and evident oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Asphalt, wet dirt, blueberry fruit and grapeseed aromas show on the nose of this dark and dense bottling. The palate starts with milk-chocolate shavings followed by tart red-cherry fruit. The acidity is overwhelming, singeing the tongue, and the tannins are a bit chunky. It should improve with cellar time.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Oak, toast and coconut aromas dominate the nose carry and over to the bracing palate along with espresso and anise.

Drink this classic Rioja now through 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tiers of blackberry jam, plum, milk chocolate, anise and smoky cedar flavors mark this layered Cabernet. It shows the thrilling balance of the vineyard, with ripe fruit in tension with minerals, brisk acidity and wonderful mountain tannins. A splash of Merlot and Cabernet Franc add soft, cherried relief to Cabernet's hardness. Drink this wine now and over the next 15 years, as it gradually sheds its fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend contains smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The grapes come from all over the valley, mountains as well as flatlands, making it a testament to the art of blending. The warmer, riper areas bring lush chocolate and blackberry jam flavors, while the cooler areas contribute structural elements of firm tannins and acidity. The result is delicious and compelling. Drink over the next four years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ripe and smooth, this is a light take on this Grand Cru.

The dominant oak sensations of vanilla, toast and coffee make it a tad anonymous in style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and heady in black currants, cassis liqueur, blackberry pie and mocha flavors, this Cab's high alcohol gives it a soft mellow mouthfeel, as well as some heat in the finish. With velvety tannins, it will pair well with a great steak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Amarone is made in a more restrained style. It shows black cherry, raisin and black pepper sensations. While it's not overly complex, it has great fruit and spice flavors, and is perfect to accompany seasoned dishes, like grilled Portobello mushroom steaks.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a thickly concentrated Recioto that delivers an inky black color and sweet, ripe fleshiness. Firm tannins give structure to all that sweet succulence and help define the wine's aromas of almond, chocolate and black cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon is succulently smooth yet big boned and slightly smoky. Red cherry and berry fruit provides plushness on the palate, upheld by tight, firm tannins and supportive oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot.

But it could have a firmer structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A 100% varietal wine from the producer's estate, this is a greasy, meaty wine, exuberant in smoky barrel background and a thicket of black licorice.

It's powerfully concentrated, densely tannic, solid and chunky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Siro Pacenti hits the nail on the head with a wine that is concentrated and rich, but elegant and fresh at the same time.

The estate's flagship wine, Biserno, will be released later this year, and expect great things from this duo in years to come as the estate matures.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Give this dramatic young Pinot time to grow up. It's super-young in jammy cherry, raspberry, licorice, cola and smoky new oak flavors, and while the tannic-acid structure is first-rate, it's a little too unresolved for full enjoyment.

The wine seems compact in its essence but reveals many delicate notes that recall forest floor, cherry cola and black currants.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Exotic spice, red fruit, herbal notes and cherry cola characterize this 50-50 blend of Alicante and Syrah. The wine delivers measured intensity but does boast deep freshness thanks to its acidity and menthol finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend sees 16 months in barrique; the result is redolent of chocolate, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and dried herbs backed by lovely fresh blueberry and blackberry. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with very good freshness and length.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine has prominent aromas that are often associated with Sangiovese: cherry, natural spice, wet earth, white mushroom, plum, cola and Mediterranean herbs. It slides broadly across the palate, with crisp freshness on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From one of Montalcino's cult producers, this wine leads with earthy aromas of underbrush, truffle, stewed plums and prune.

The palate starts off with fleshy black cherry accented with notes of cinnamon-spice layered with bitter dark chocolate, but it finishes on a note of drying tannins. You'll also notice the hefty alcohol on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At the age of more than five years, this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend still is tannic and rich in primary fruit flavors. The black cherry, raspberry, mocha and spice flavors taste fresh. Yet the wine is throwing some sediment, an indication it's rapidly getting ready to enter its next stage of bottle age. Enjoy it now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This estate continues to improve every year and has made an outstanding effort with the 2009 vintage.

With an earthiness of compost and wood, it shows a touch of reduction as it finishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of woodland berry, toast, clove and chopped herb emerge in the glass. The palate is still rather closed, eventually giving up raw red berry, coconut, espresso, oak and grilled sage alongside tightly wound, astringent tannins. Give this a few more years to open up. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of charred earth, forest floor, truffle, sage and mature berry lead the nose.

Give the tannins a few more years to unclench then drink to capture the remaining fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Menthol, mature black currant, eucalyptus, espresso and clove aromas lead the nose. On the austere palate, ground pepper and licorice accent mature black cherry while assertive, close-grained tannins leave a firm finish.

Streamlined and tight, with great power on the close. A very compact and tightly constructed wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a tight, streamlined Brunello characterized by a toasted or charred almond note and bright forest notes of wild berry and underbrush. The mouthfeel is lean and tight, and there's a tannic firmness that holds it together.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lots of nice blackberry, cassis, plum and new oak flavors in this dry, tannic Cabernet. It hews to an old-fashioned style, with an earthiness that suggests time in the cellar. Try after 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine has a more vinous nose with bold cherry and raspberry aromas followed by leather, spice and Spanish cedar. Textured and firm, bright and fresh.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A meaty, bulky, earthy style of Ribera with smoky, charred, new-oak aromas setting up a reduced-seeming palate with roasted, sweet flavors of black fruits and cured meats. Feels rich, sticky and candied on the finish. Needs a couple of years to knit together; may improve with bottle age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's ripe cherry fruit and milk chocolate notes suggest softness and roundness. But the wine shows astringency and firmness on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard has had a mixed record of producing reds, usually expensive, not always great. This Syrah is too sugary sweet, with jammy berry and fruit flavors and lots of caramelly oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot shows an uneasy mix of green coffee bean, cherry, char and meaty notes. The cherry flavors are medium bodied backed by a wall of firm, dry tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leafy underbrush, fennel, hay, savory herb and dried berry aromas come together in the glass. The palate lacks fruit richness but offers raw red berry, espresso, dried sage and anisette alongside astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of cured meat, stewed fruit and toasted oak lead the nose. On the ripe palate, notes of powdered sage, vanilla and oak spices accent fleshy black plum. Bracing tannins provide the framework, but drink soon to capture the fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggest toast, mocha, vanilla, dark-skinned fruit and a whiff of burnt matches. The oak-driven spices carry over to the palate along with a licorice note but not much fruit richness. Astringent tannins provide the backbone.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an elegant Nebbiolo-based wine and arguably the most feminine of Gaja's newest releases. There's extreme balance and sophistication evident in the focused aromas of wild berry, white licorice, pressed violets and polished stone. The mouthfeel is tight, firm and those tannins need at least 10 more years to soften in your cellar. Beautiful.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Always a standout among Gaja's five single-vineyard wines, Sor\\u00c3\\u00ac San Lorenzo benefits from an excellent vintage to produce what will surely become a must-have bottle for collectors of Italian wine. There's enormous beauty and elegance here, backed by power and intensity with ripe fruit, spice, toasted nut and cola. It also shows impressive linearity and focus. Hold for 10 years or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sperss (the name is inspired by the local word for \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnostalgia\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d) is a vineyard located in the Barolo territory of Serralunga. Angelo Gaja adds 6% Barbera to the wine for brightness and freshness but the overall ensemble shows so much more than that. It delivers sophisticated softness and a velvety texture that is backed by exotic spice and loads of wild berry and licorice. Add huge depth and intensity and you have the criteria for a cellar-worthy wine. Will be ready to drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from Carneros-grown grapes, this Syrah strikes the palate as rather candied in blackberries and cherries. It's smooth in the mouth, and the oak brings a pretty layer of smoky cedar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Carillon opens with a dark, concentrated appearance and smoky aromas of barbecue, spice and toasted oak. The fruit element comes forth on the palate, revealing the wine's bright cherry and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The subtle, subdued nose is of perfumed spice, dried red rose and currant. But there is chewy softness here and enough extraction to hold the wine firm on the palate. The structure is there but the fruit definition is less apparent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spicy wood notes, dark fruit, rum cake, dried ginger, licorice and cola add up to an ethereal and elegant Brunello that is more smooth and silky than it is bold and bulky. Spice, sandalwood and cedar appear on the close, but it has a compact, streamlined structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello shows elegant aromatic restraint in its tight aromas of wild berry and red currant. Dark flavors of barbecue spice, cured meat, leather and tobacco layer the midpalate, then turn fine and full on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense and heavy, and maybe a touch dull on the nose in terms of fruit aromas. But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep purple in color, with roasted, rubbery aromas of wild blackberry. Thick, lush and rich in the mouth, with mellow tannins (for a Priorat wine) and big, broad flavors of plum, blackberry and herbs. Smooth on the finish, with black tea notes and leftover oak. Has a lot going for it; drink now through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the 2004 vintage, this Cuv\\u00c3\\u00a9e sparkling wine (80-20 Chardonnay and Pinot Nero) offers sophisticated aromas of baked bread, butterscotch and molasses. The color boasts a deep golden hue and the mouthfeel shows both impressive density and staying power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Caramel and vanilla aromas, the palate rounded, poised, with pear and green plum flavors, along with lively acidity, filled out with toast.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From what is always the Grand Cru that develops most quickly, this is a gorgeous, already very drinkable, ripe wine, certainly fresh. Maybe there is a more mineral character than usual, allied to higher acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There is an explosion of ripe yellow fruit here, giving a ripe, tropical feel. Spice, mango, it's quite a powerhouse of flavors. This is a gorgeous, opulent wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toast, dried apricot and nut. The palate offers lemon zest, dried yellow apple and oak-driven spices, but most of the fruit has already dried up. It closes on a note of bitter almond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and powerfully structured, this is dense with bold blackberry flavors and dark tannins that give a firm structure. However, as so often with 2013, it's the fruit that shines in this rich wine. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, wild mint, dill, coffee and tobacco emerge on this full-bodied red. The round palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, chopped herb and a hint of black pepper framed in velvety tannins while a licorice note closes the finish. Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hugely brawny in dark blackberry, plum and cinnamon, this wine packs a punch despite its coastal influence. Black pepper and smoke provide the savory aspect, while cranberry and strawberry the softer, prettier side of the story. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Produced from young vines, this fresh, fruity wine offers immediate pleasure, with red berries and sweet fruit flavors over a spicy layer of wood and a soft, generous texture.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With ripe blackberry, blueberry, cherry, cocoa and oak flavors, and smooth tannins, this is a delightful wine to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This concentrated wine floods the mouth with flavors of cherries, blackberry jam, milk chocolate, vanilla and toast. The tannins are remarkably pure, and the finish is dry. The one issue is high alcohol, which gives the wine a chili pepper heat.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The alcohol is refreshingly moderate in this dry, silky Pinot. The flavors are quite complex, suggesting wild cherries and raspberries, mushrooms, cola and sandalwood, with hints of balsam and herbs. The wine should age well, but the acidic sharpness on the finish will always be prominent.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This robust red opens with aromas of espresso, plum cake, toast and dark spice. The hearty palate offers blackberry jam, licorice, vanilla and mocha alongside firm fine-grained tannins. A coffee note closes the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, tilled soil, mature berry and a whiff of new leather combine on this. The ripe palate offers fleshy black cherry, dried aromatic herb and tobacco, while fine-grained tannins give the finish some grip. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from two parcels in Aloxe Corton, this structured wine has red-plum fruitiness that is still masked by a dry tannic coating. It has concentration and good potential. Drink this textured, firm wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a big, hearty wine that opens with aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, truffle, stewed black-skinned fruit and a whiff of menthol. The palate offers blackberry jam, cherries marinated in spirits, coffee, mocha and a confectionary note alongside the warmth of evident alcohol. It's already rather evolved and accessible, with velvety tannins. Drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soupy heavy aromas suggest that the sun-baked conditions of 2011 got the better of this wine. In the mouth, this feels jammy and thick, with a shortage of balance and elegance. This tastes stewy, with meaty berry flavors and licorice notes. A heavy finish confirms a sense of overripeness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright red fruit complements mellowed tannins in this estate-grown wine that's moderately complex and layered. Cedar and herb show up in spades.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero, this opens with subtle aromas of toasted bread crust, mature pear and a note of wild herb. The elegant palate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094which is made without dosage\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094offers ripe Golden Delicious apple, sour lemon drop and hazelnut alongside a refined perlage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rooty/ berry aromas come with a big heaping of mature earth tones and cool cola accents. This is ripped with acidity, which makes sense since 2008 was a chilly, wet year. Bold berry, plum, cherry and tobacco flavors finish easy and smooth; drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% varietal wine from the producer's famous vineyard is sanguine in red currant and woody tannin. Full bodied and substantial in body and spirit, it has alluring aromatics of sage and mountain brush, remaining balanced in acidity despite the intensity and power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine earns its high score by virtue of sheer richness. It's enormous in blackberry, cassis, roasted meat, licorice, black pepper and smoky cedar flavors, and finishes dry and spicy. There's a tannic toughness that resists the palate, and doesn't seem likely to age out, so drink over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from one of the best vineyard sites in Savigny-l\\u00c3\\u00a8s-Beaune, on the slope closest to Beaune. It is a smooth, perfumed and ripe wine that has a balanced structure under the bright red-cherry flavor. Still bursting with young fruit, the wine will age, so wait to drink until 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Allowing Zinfandel to take the 60% lead in this marriage with Cabernet Sauvignon, this is an impressive mingling of the two. Black pepper, clove and leathery cigar fuel a high-powered succulence of black and red fruit accented by a smoky drawl.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the most inky, concentrated, fiercely tannic vintages of Alion to date. Aromas of granite, boysenberry and grilled meat feed into a biting, full-bodied palate that can only benefit from more time. Blackberry, vanilla and chocolate flavors finish with mocha notes and stocky, rugged tannins. This is fierce and unrefined now; drink from 2018 through 2027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Damaged by hail in 2013, the vineyards yielded low quantities. The grapes harvested produced a wine with crisp red fruits and bright berry acidity. The fresh, tight aftertaste suggests the wine will age. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The fruit is plenty ripe, offering rich flavors of blackberries and black currants, and the finish is thoroughly dry. The drawback with this Cab is its texture. It's rough and angular, suggesting unevenly ripe stems and seeds. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While the texture is rich and full-bodied, there is an edge of sharp acidity that takes away from the generous ripeness. Tannins and juicy red fruits are present, but the acidity is a little jarring.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured wine opens with aromas of subtle oak, toast, leather, espresso and dried plum. The extracted palate delivers prune, crushed black cherry, soy sauce and grilled herbs framed by bracing tannins that leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fresh Amarone offers an inviting fragrance of perfumed berry and exotic spice. Notes of graphite, black pepper and clove give depth to the ripe plum and blackberry flavors. It's balanced with firm, chewy tannins.

The smooth palate delivers black plum, prune, black pepper and exotic spice alongside velvety tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage. It closes on a licorice note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cedar, coconut, tobacco and earthy berry aromas are typical of Rioja. This is juicy and zesty in the mouth, with bright acidity. Flavors of berry, vanilla and earth finish strong. This is an excellent but not overly complicated wine; drink through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A sweet nose of oak spice, almond marzipan and cherry cola makes for a nice first impression. It boasts loads of balsam intensity with cola, ginger and black licorice. It's ripe, chewy and covers the palate while delivering tight structure on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hard and crusty on first impression, with smoky, leathery, meaty aromas along with hints of wild herbs and dark berry fruit. Feels racy and ultraslick, with cherry, plum and mineral flavors. Hits all the right notes while not pushing any buttons too hard or too often; long on the finish. Drink now through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dark, garnet-colored appearance with brooding, masculine tones of spice, ripe fruit, dark cherry, as well as beautiful balsam notes of cola, dried mint and ginger. Balanced, not overdone. Let the tannins soften with age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black licorice, cola and cherry liqueur open the nose and segue to black currant and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis aromas, then forest floor, bramble and Spanish cedar. This wine is linear, crisp and tight on the palate, with firm tannins. Give the wine five more years to soften.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sweet new wood goes with rich plum skins in a wine that has a firm structure. The richness of the wine revolves around sweet cherries and juicy acidity. With the wood still dominant, it needs at least five years to settle down.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This dark wine opens with bright fruit aromas that are soft and straightforward. The wine presents bold cherry, blackberry and spicy rum cake flavors, and a mouthfeel that is fresh and round. The finish is dominated by chewy berry fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a youthful expression of Sangiovese Grosso in which the grape's trademark acidity and fruity brightness shine through. Cherry, white almond, dried raspberry and rum cake notes present a soft, chewy feel in the mouth, although the overall structure is solid.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dark, masculine, brooding Brunello, with savory aromas of leather and cured meat behind ripe fruit and blackberry. It's tight and clean, with a streamlined mouthfeel that testifies to the wine's firm tannic structure. Executed in a traditional style, it shows possibilities for long-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Warm spice and dark fruit tones with cured meat, bresaola, licorice, black pepper, leather and tobacco define this expression. The wine is plush rich, structured and firm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A solid wine, with plum skin and dry tannin textures. It does have the ripe fruit of 2009, attractive red fruits and juicy acidity. But it needs aging over at least three years to show its fruitiness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 2006 Pertimali tastes better than the 2006 Riserva and the 2007 Brunello. This wine is uniquely characterized by bold freshness and richness showing the clean and precise quality of Sangiovese fruit. The aftertaste is long, spicy and firm. Give this wine 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spice, cherry liqueur, dark fruit, leather and moist tobacco comprise the bouquet. Structured and firm, the wine delivers a clean, focused feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of crushed black cherry, mature plum, black pepper, blue flower and tilled earth lead the nose on this vibrant, full-bodied wine.

Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Chardonnay and Pinot Nero and made without dosage, this opens with a delicate but alluring fragrance of white flower, citrus, stone fruit and pastry notes. The smooth, silky palate delivers lemon zest, ripe red apple, candied ginger and a yeasty note of baked bread alongside a soft, persistent mousse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense and delicious, this opens with aromas of plum cake, tobacco, leather and blackberry.

Give it time to unwind and fully develop.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An estate-grown Pinot Noir from the wilds of Freestone, this wine delivers in high acidity and perfumed aromatics that are highlighted by violet and sandalwood. The taste leans towards tart cherry and strawberry. Medium in weight, it's a structured wine, with just the right amount of heft and oak on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a newer planting of the Durell Vineyard called the Ranch House Block, this Pinot is rocking in deep, delicious baked strawberry and raspberry fruit, fruity, lush and spicy yet balanced and tempting. The texture is satisfyingly velvety and complete.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An aromatic opening of compost and vinegar might suggest casting this aside. But flavors of strawberry and chocolate, along with an admitted weedy note, amount to something decent. Finishing notes of brown sugar and berry syrup are chocolaty and ensure that this finishes better than it begins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cherry, plum, spice and a pungent touch of dried apple skin gives the bouquet a bright, immediate feel. In the mouth, this fine Amarone delivers tight tannins and fresh intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a unique wine for enthusiasts of the natural wine movement. It shows a dark garnet color, with spicy aromas of dried fruit, currant and Indian spice. A bright tone of dried mint and rosemary lingers on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Palmaz has struggled to break into the top ranks, and this 2006 does not advance their cause. It smells funky and vegetal, although it turns fairly rich in the mouth, with cherries, red licorice, cocoa and cedar. Doesn't seem likely to improve over time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is just over half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. The aromas of herb, barrel spice, black cherry and coffee need time to reveal themselves fully. The dark cherry and blackberry flavors show richness and polish. Give it an extended decant if opening in the near term but it will be worth it. It will be best from 2020 to 2027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas of tobacco leaf, herbs, milk chocolate, vanilla and dark cherries are generous on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The flavors are equal part rich and restrained, with a delightful sense of balance along with a light grip of tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine rises up from the glass with an earthy funk, dried herbs, black pepper, cherry, smoke and mineral, showing complexities and detail. The palate is restrained yet rich, with savory flavors that linger.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brooding aromas of fresh and dried herbs mix with freshly tilled soil, tomato leaf, coffee, mineral and spice box. It's restrained in style with supple smoke, herb and cherry flavors backed by soft tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A soft wine without real definition, it has an attractive fruity character, but it's missing the firm structure of the appellation. With its vanilla and apricot flavors, this ripe Chardonnay is ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At the age of nearly five years, this Syrah is soft, mellow and sweet. It has flavors of raspberry jam, bacon, brown sugar and cinnamon spice. Won't get any better, so drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This very rich, unctuous Syrah is immature and not especially subtle at this time. It's acidic and gooey in jammy blackberries and cherries and milk chocolate, with obvious oak influences. The idea seems to be ageworthiness, but that's a gamble. Could surprise.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine that shows the ripe tannins of Saint-Est\\u00c3\\u00a8phe. It has a dry, dark core that's surrounded by rich black currant fruit. Situated close to Calon-S\\u00c3\\u00a9gur, this is a stylish selection that exudes power and structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rough-hewn and tannic in youth, this blend of one-third each Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot isn't showing much accessibility. It's astringently closed, but very ripe and sweet in blackberries, cherries and cedar. Give it five years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The full force of aromatic, dried pear rises from the glass, laced with dried apricot and candied peel. The pear fruit becomes exquisitely clear and pure on the palate, which is profound but slender.

Drink now till 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opening with aromas of crushed violet, ripe plum and black pepper, this is one Amarone that seamlessly combines a hefty structure with finesse.

The delicious palate offers juicy wild cherry, raspberry jam, vanilla, cinnamon and licorice while pliant, velvety tannins offer elegant support. It deftly combines power and finesse. Drink through 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is dark and dense, very closed at this young stage. But wait for that rich fruit to burst out to give its intense acidity and ripeness to the wine. It's a powerhouse of flavors, spice and dark minerality. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is dark, with a strong sense of structure. Dense black fruits are cut with strawberry acidity and a dark tension between fruit and firm tannins. The coiled power will allow this beautiful wine age for many years.

Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the top Premier Cru vineyards in Beaune, this structured wine shows concentration and richness. Packed with tannins in its center, it is cushioned by the generous red berry and cherry fruits. The wine has a finely perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From vines close to the Sachets Premier Cru vineyard, this wine is powerful, structured and dense, despite the relatively low alcohol that gives it a lift of red fruits, acidity and perfume. It is still developing, a wine in progress, as its backbone of tannins softens. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bold, full-bodied and polished, this opens with aromas that recall violets, ripe plums, red berries and cake spices. The smooth, savory palate delivers juicy Morello cherries, black raspberries, cinnamon, mocha, white pepper and a hint of mint. Generous, velvety tannins provide the framework and add finesse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and thick, this is an opulent offering of dark cherry and Asian spice, the spice popping on the palate throughout the long finish. Full bodied, it nonetheless features crisp, balanced acidity and a taste of rosemary and lavender, the perfect companion to a butterflied lamb seasoned the same.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A seriously good Cabernet that advances the cause of Sonoma Valley. It's soft and rich and decadently good, offering wave after wave of blackberry pie, cherry jam and sweet oak flavors that are a little on the sweet side. Shows enough acidity and tannin structure to provide balance. Drink now with a good steak, chop or lamb dish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep and dark, with cola, blackberry and mossy aromas. This is full-bodied, tight and tannic, with hardness that will only be tempered by food and/or more time in bottle. Tastes bold, chunky and ripe, with chocolate and licorice along with heat and tannic fire. Drink now through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an impressive bottling from the Parrish family. Thick in the glass, it shows aromas of candied black currant, caramel, purple flowers and a hint of smoke. The palate is full and hearty with black cherry, clove and baking spice flavors. Its richness is balanced by tangy acidity and tannins that are generous but soft and well-polished.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The grandest of the Chablis Grand Crus has produced a structured, still very young, wine.

Its rich yellow fruit and taut acidity suggest it will taste best from from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From hillside vineyards on just one acre of the producer's estate, this lovely wine is pungently earthy in violet and fresh compost, its profile bright and lean. Cherry, orange and pomegranate make for a compelling expression of the variety, complemented by a meaty, gamy tease on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the grandest of the Grand Cru vineyards, this wine is powerful and structured. Its intense white and yellow fruit gains extra richness from subtle wood aging. It's juicy, ripe and full in the mouth.

Bright and silky, the refined palate delivers yellow apple, peach and Bartlett pear set against crisp acidity and a refined perlage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Eucalyptus, Bay laurel and other herbal aromas dominate the nose of this wine, making way for black tea and cola flavors. Full-bodied and robustly ripe with powerful tannin, it's ultimately earthy and complex.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This intensely ripe wine is made predominantly from Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of Malbec and Merlot. Its waxy cherry, currant and blueberry flavers are laced wtih milk chocolate and smoky oak richness, a dash of high-toned acidity sparking on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Beautifully rich for such a lowly appellation in the Burgundy hierarchy. It is soft, open, dense, with ripeness and balancing acidity as well as flavors of pineapple and citrus pointing up the richness, just touched by wood.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wood is too much for the fruit with this wine. At this stage in its development, there is a bitter, high toast character that dominates the white fruits. Underneath all this toast, there are hints of fresh apples and cream flavors. Give it at least a year.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tones of leather, tobacco and wild mushroom are followed by accents of ripe fruit and blackberry preserves. Notes of rum cake, licorice and Indian spice give complexity to this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the wilds of Atlas Peak, this lovely wine is dense and concentrated in mountain fruit and lengthy tannin\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the oak and weight well-integrated and complex. Pie crust, vanilla and clove provide a sultry luxury and invitation.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Nero d'Avola opens with mature black cherry, cinnamon and toasted almond aromas while the fresh, structured palate delivers juicy blackberry, raspberry jam and white pepper notes. Fresh acidity and polished tannins lend balance and a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Austere and elegant in its cool-climate, light-bodied way, this wine is dark and brooding nonetheless, offering a wild bramble of berry and rhubarb flavors. Firm in tannin and subtle in oak, it is dotted in black-tea and savory forest-floor edges.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the kind of wine only severe lot selection can achieve. The flavors are deep and impressive, ranging from cassis to chocolate. Oak provides smoke and spice. It has that brilliant, velvety texture you expect from wines of this caliber, but, like so many such bottlings, it lacks the acidity to provide backbone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At the northern end of the Ladoix appellation, this small Premier Cru has produced a red-fruited wine shot through with acidity and spicy flavors. It is juicy, showing red cherries, raspberries bolstered with a layer of tannins. The wine is ready to drink, although it will age at least until 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stewed prune, blue flower, Asian spice and a whiff of oak come together on this. The dense palate offers raisin, blackberry extract, tobacco, vanilla and licorice alongside firm fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017 through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of three wines produced by the estate created by the late Anne-Claude Leflaive of Domaine Leflaive in Burgundy. This wine uses the very local Grolleau, grown biodynamically. Unusually this is a red wine (Grolleau is normally found in ros\\u00c3\\u00a9). The wine is lightly stalky with red-currant fruit and intense acidity. It is light in texture but rich in complexity, and has some aging potential. Drink now, but better from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Unusually, this premier cru vineyard produces both red and white wines, both of which are made by this domaine. The wine is soft, rounded and with a ripe creamy character. It has plenty of crisp apple and rich pear flavors along with enough acidity to keep it bright and tangy. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Four parcels in the Clos du Roi Premier Cru go into this wine. It is structured and firm\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a wine for aging. It has a strongly mineral character, concentrated tannins as well as black-cherry fruit and freshening acidity. Drink the wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The best Sterling reserve Merlots are ageworthy. The others are merely tannic. This '05 straddles the line. It's certainly a dry, tannicly astringent wine that shuts down the palate. But you'll find some rich black cherry and currant flavors. Roll the dice and give it through 2010 to come around.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Orange peel and zesty tangerine follow aromas of honey and butterscotch. Moscato della Torre is a smooth and generous wine with intense flavors and medium acidity. Drink it alone or with aged cheese.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plum and blueberry combine to nice effect in this wine that is dense and chewy at the beginning but yields softer textures as it goes. A sprinkling of cocoa and cinnamon accents the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. High-toned aromas of dried herb, barrel spice and red and black fruit are followed by well concentrated fruit flavors. The tannins show considerably more grip than is often seen from this site. Give it some time in the cellar to unwind. Best after 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black currant, cedar, prune, spice and just a whiff of barnyard lead the nose on this young Amarone. The dense palate delivers baked plum, stewed prune, nutmeg and clove alongside tightly-knit, bracing tannins. It finishes on an astringent note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: For the wine and its fruit, there is too much firm extract here. It brings out very dry tannins and licorice flavors that cover the fruit. It's going to be a difficult wine to soften.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, mature berry, wild herb, clove, smoke and pressed flower aromas come together on this bright red. The taut palate delivers ripe red cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and white pepper set against firm, polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, rose, blue flower, tilled soil and Alpine herb aromas set the pace on this luminous red. The firm palate is still young and closed but already shows ripe red berry, wild cherry, mocha anise, clove and a hint of toast. Youthfully assertive but refined tannins and fresh acidity lend structure and balance.

From two separate, rocky blocks on the winery property, this wine is concentrated and smooth. Enjoy through 2021\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Absolutely smooth and pleasantly soft on the palate, this has layers of rich fruit, subtle baking spices and touches of pine forest. Moderate acidity and fine tannins stay in the background yet lift the aroma, flavor and finish to a high level of pleasure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Located in the wilds of Annapolis, the vineyard will be familiar to fans of extreme Sonoma Coast wines. This vintage will be the winery's last from the site, according to the winery. Earthy cinnamon bark surrounds refined tannins and complex layers of high-toned cherry and raspberry before evocative dried herbs hit the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of leather, underbrush, ripe red berry and eucalyptus lead the nose on this structured wine. The delicious palate delivers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and savory herb alongside big, chewy tannins. It ends on a succulent note. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a fine, young Cabernet, rich in pastry-filling blackberries, cherries, black raspberries, cassis and sweet toasted oak notes. Already throwing some sediment, it should glide effortlessly through the next eight years, gaining bottle interest.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dry as dust and very tannic, this Cabernet simply isn't ready for prime time yet. It's tightly wound and tough, and resists breaking down. But there are plenty of blackberries tucked deep inside. Hold this elegant wine until after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich, sleek Cabernet, made in a controlled manner emphasizing dry elegance rather than massive fruit. You'll find complex blackberry, tobacco and mocha flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. Now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is rich and surprisingly warm for the normally cool appellation of Pernand Vergelesses. It makes for an attractive, ripe and creamy wine that's been given a wood aging. But it doesn't have a sense of place.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with savory aromas of fennel, dark berry, bell pepper and cedar. The firm palate offers black currant, black cherry, clove and Mediterranean herbs. Assertive but fine-grained tannins add elegance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firmly structured and elegant, this offers aromas of pressed rose, violet, menthol, savory herb and woodland berry. The palate is still closed but reveals crunchy red cherry, oak, mint and sage alongside youthfully austere tannins that need time to unfold. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hearty and soulful, this offers aromas of tilled soil, leather, game and woodland berry. The meaty palate is still very tightly wound, delivering black cherry, plum, grilled sage, licorice and tobacco alongside bold tannins. Hold until 2018 then enjoy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and a splash of Petit Verdot, this offers bright red berry, menthol, cedar, espresso and savory herb aromas. On the palate, polished tannins support juicy dark cherry, blackberry, licorice, coffee and toasted notes. Enjoy through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with organically farmed grapes, this opens with pretty aromas of crushed rose, violet, perfumed berry, leather, truffle and a balsamic note. The warm palate doles out fleshy wild cherry, stewed plum, cake spice, anisette and savory herb alongside velvety tannins. It closes on a licorice note and the heat of evident alcohol. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Petit Verdot and 10% Merlot opens with aromas of blackberry, cedar and exotic spice.

The juicy palate offers black currant, cassis, black pepper, savory herb and licorice alongside polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth and medium bodied, this offers lithe layers of licorice and meat, its tannins refined. The high-toned cassis, cranberry and cherry make themselves known, but will develop further, through 2027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Barolo Vigna Merenda opens with a bright bouquet composed of cherry, spice, floral and balsam elements. This is also an extremely mineral-driven wine that exposes a vein of graphite or crushed stone at its core. Thanks to the wine's natural structure and long persistency, it would make a perfect pairing partner to any dish with black truffles.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Boroli is a dynamic winery worth keeping a close eye on. Barolo Villero takes a traditional approach that speaks highly of the beautifully hilly area that shaped the wine. Delicate aromas include wild berries, dried orange zest, apple skin, licorice, tar and cigar box. In the mouth, the wine is streamlined and tight.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big Barbaresco executed in a bold, modern style that can either be consumed immediately, or can be put aside to age in your cellar. Soft layers of spice, nutmeg and vanilla are enhanced by bursting flavors of cherry and blueberry. The wine is rich, dense and opulent overall.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The celebrated Cerequio cru is known for its elegant and refined wines. However, in this hot vintage, you can taste the maturity of the fruit thanks to the wine's aromas of plum, prune and spice cake. Clay soils help shape the wine's natural density and structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Brunate cru, with denser soils, is known for meatier, more structured wines. This Barolo offers elegance, power and complexity with lingering aromas of exotic spice, black fruit and root beer. It's also exceptionally bright and lively in the mouth and would pair with a hearty wintery dish such as beef Bourguignon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a very interesting and unique Asian quality here that reveals itself on the nose as saffron, soya, clove and Chinese barbecue sauce. The wine is lean and compact in the mouth with a long, silky finish: Hold five to 10 years in your cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an extremely distinctive and site-specific expression of Barbaresco from the celebrated Roncaglie cru. The wine is characterized by feminine, delicate tones of subtle Indian spice, pressed rose petal, violets and light vanilla or white chocolate. It boasts well-integrated freshness and finely polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Continues a string of successful bottlings of this Cabernet. The flavors are strong but subtle, suggesting blackberries and black currants, with earthier notes of dark chocolate and roasted almonds. Very good, but also pretty tannic. You'll want to cellar this for 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years to let it mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the hot year of 2009, this is a ripe, mature, sun-kissed wine. It has smooth yellow fruit and mango flavors along with a soft and rounded texture. It's naturally rich, full in the mouth and totally ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Flinty reduction still dominates the nose but this is only a sign of youth in this nuanced wine. It discloses tentative pear blossom and fruit, plus notions of wet earth and candied lime. Above all, a zesty spine of acidity and freshness directs all the attention to a profound, stony core. There is life force here and you know this will continue to evolve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in tiny quantities, this wine opens with aromas of crisp, just-peeled orange before unveiling silky tannins and a bite of oak. Light in color, it builds up layers of dark cherry, sage and mushroomy earth as it develops, with a substantial kick of texture and weight on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of crushed violet, baked plum, cake spice, ripe berry and tobacco pervade in this bold, full-bodied red. The firm palate offers ripe black cherry, fig, mocha, nutmeg, licorice and tobacco alongside velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fully ripe, juicy pears glow from the core of this balanced, rounded wine, with an edge of marzipan, bitter almond and a wonderfully textured center. The palate is rich but dry and stays on the side of restraint, despite the fullness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There are not many village wines made in Vougeot with the large areas devoted to Premier and Grand Cru. This wine has reminiscences of the structure of those top wines although it is delicious in its fragrant strawberries, full and with just the right amount of acidity. The fruit comes from the Clos du Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Riserva La Volta exhibits smoky tones of charcoal, black slate, licorice and dried black currant backed by toasted peanut or roasted chestnut. The toasted element, which seems to have become more prominent with time, is a bit overwhelming and definitely the wine's defining characteristic.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: So rich and seemingly sweet in black currant, chocolate fudge and toasted oak flavors, you can hardly keep from drinking the whole bottle now. But that would be a mistake. You don't want to age it so long that all the fruit drops out, but 8\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years in the cellar should do just fine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Compared to its basic Brunello, Querceta ups the ante with this Riserva in terms of intensity and overall power. Bold notes of cherry, spice and leather make an appearance in this fresh and firmly structured offering.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Marchese Lodovico Antinori's beautiful wine estate in Bibbona, this boasts the heritage of the great super Tuscan family to which it belongs. The blend is Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, and the overall effect is simply gorgeous. Richness, generosity and persistence characterize the mouthfeel, and the bouquet is driven by aromas of red cherry, chocolate and spice. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An iconic wine of Italy and deservedly so, Biondi-Santi captures the spirit of the 2007 vintage with his clear fruit interpretations of red cherry, blackberry and cassis. The wine shows power, structure and fresh acidity that drives the long finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This starts out a bit coarse, with strong tannins that have a rough-edged feeling. It's very rich in blackberries and black currants, but showing more power than elegance. Time in the glass certainly opens it up, revealing a rich, heady cassis note. While the alcohol is high, it may easily develop bottle complexity over the next 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its big, hard tannins, this is one for the cellar. There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries. The youthful brawniness softens after some time in the glass or decanter, but you're best off aging it until 2019 or so.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Delicious and classy, this is based on Merlot, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties in proper proportion. It flatters immediately with its wealth of blackberries, black cherries, cola and mocha that finish so dry and spicy, yet it has that extra complexity that makes it intellectually interesting. Drink now and over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is delicious, right up there with a great Cabernet. First of all, there's the smoothly tannic and velvety mouthfeel. Then there's the flavors that are wildly attractive in blackberries, black licorice, crispy bacon and something purple and flowery, like violets. The grapes comes from a vineyard in the Mayacamas range that only qualifies for the county appellation. It's expensive, yes, but it tastes expensive.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. The palate does offer some, however, with grippy tannins and dried oregano touches laid across rich black cherry, blueberry, fudge and espresso notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With some firm structure behind the red fruits, this wine will have a good future. A dry core sustained by the acidity is waiting to burst out and give a ripe, fruity while always fresh wine. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas bring notes of vanilla bean, black cherry and cassis, along with light volatility. The palate packs a big punch of fruit and barrel flavors, with vanilla notes running high throughout, causing some distraction.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Weedy and herbal, this Merlot-based blend is thick and rich in black cherry and medium oak, with an abbreviated finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and flashy in blackberries, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur, this Cab feels fancy all the way through to the dry, spicy finish. The tannins kick in midway, giving it a scour of astringency that suggests the cellar. Yet it's really too soft and one-dimensional for anything beyond 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years before the fruit dies.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grilled herb, dark spice, forest floor, toast and oak aromas lead the nose. The palate is dense, its mature black cherry, espresso, licorice and tobacco flavors drawn tight with close-grained tannins that leave a compact finish.

On the creamy, full-bodied palate, lime and hazelnut flavors accent a core of juicy yellow peach. Enjoy through 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this offers blueberry, cedar and bell pepper aromas. The palate is juicy, full of red currant, vanilla and Mediterranean herb flavors, held firm with polished tannins and a tart finish. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe complete wine. With its tannins and rich structure balanced by the generous black fruits, it has weight. Cut by the acidity of the vintage, this is serious, complex and worthy of aging.

On the full-bodied palate, tobacco and aniseed accent a core of ripe black cherry, while firm tannins provide support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo is tightly wound, with aggressive tannins and nervous acidity. It lacks complexity and richness despite its core of black cherry fruit. It also shows evident alcoholic warmth and finishes on a green, astringent note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This young Barbaresco is somewhat closed, but offers floral Nebbiolo fragrance and toasted oak. The palate shows cherry, spice and coffee notes, but also green, unripe sensations. Finishes short, with drying wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nice and dry, with a good bite of firm tannins, but it's a little flat in the flavor profile. Shows decent cherry, berry, herb and cedar flavors that could be more vibrant and complex. But it is elegantly structured.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature berry, espresso, exotic spice and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied red. The palate shows dried black cherry, coconut, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside fine-grained tannins. This isn't a classic Nebbiolo but it's polished, balanced and will appeal to those who enjoy oak-driven sensations.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Woodland berry, pressed violet, dark cooking spice, truffle and new leather aromas unfold on this brawny wine. The full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, ground pepper, licorice and tobacco accompanied by velvety tannins. It closes on notes of menthol and the warmth of alcohol.

The palate tightens up that fun a bit but stays sexy, offering dark chocolate, red-berry jam and a shred of mint.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine shows intense mountain tannins and fruity concentration. The flavors differ from those produced in Napa's mountains, veering more toward red berries and red currants than Napa's black ones. Oak plays a major role, but never overpowers. With 24% Merlot, this needs cellaring; don't pop the cork before 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A dense, sumptuously structured wine that is full both of tannins and juicy fruit. Black plum, layers of acidity and the lightest hint of wood aging all play a part in this already drinkable wine. It will be better in five years, so wait until 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Most remarkable is the balance of smooth, complex tannins and acidity. The powerful oak is well balanced, keeping with the wine's volume. The cherry-pie filling, red currant and spice flavors are rich and complex. The wine will be best now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A green olive note is tangy in umami flavor, adding interest to the blackberry and cherry fruit.

Dynamic and fruity, it has a dark structure that impressively expresses this solid terroir. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's another inky Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne monster with aging potential from Epoch and their historic Paderewski Vineyard. This Syrah-led blend throws off inviting aromas of black cherry pie, violet, fennel and balsamic vinegar reduction. Once sipped, layers of flavor emerge steadily, with blackberry fruit roll-up, wet pipe tobacco, candied nuts, lingering herbs and a slight vanilla finish.

Stony scents blend with latex and Band-Aid, while lemon peel and hard-driving berry aromas define the nose. Monster tannins are absorbed by the wine's broad foundation, while flavors of smoke, oak, plum and wild berry finish savory and long, with a final shot of oak-based clove. Best from 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While showing some smoky wood, this wine is more about pure fruitiness with yellow fruit flavors given a crisper shot with acidity.

This 2011 is a big, bold and fruity wine that shows red fruits, a sweet texture and good acidity. It's powerful and dark, jammy as well as structured. The wood flavors are still showing strongly and need to soften. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's dark berry cinnamon, blue flower and truffle aromas come together in the glass. The taut palate shows Morello cherry, cranberry and white pepper notes alongside firm acidity and somewhat grainy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, maturing fruit flavors bring blackberries and sweet plums to the fore.

It's already rather evolved so drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Conca vineyard in La Morra, this Barolo shows the uneven ripening that plagued much of this village in 2009. It shows predominantly wood aromas of chocolate and toast, and the palate is also dominated by oak sensations. The fruit appears to have dried up, leaving only aggressive, astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is dominated by oak, toasted coffee beans and a hint of meat juices. The palate is short and finishes on a green note, with bitter wood tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Enticing Sangiovese aromas of truffle, ripe dark-skinned berry, pressed violet and new leather lead the way on this delicious red. The smooth succulent palate doles out juicy Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, baking spice and wild herb framed in velvety tannins that envelope the palate while a licorice note wraps around the finish.

Drink from 2026.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With its potent mixture of intense fruit and equally concentrated structure, this wine is an obvious candidate for long-term aging.

The palate doles out candied nectarine, maple syrup, white almond and glazed brown sugar.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Red chewy fruit that's succulent and satisfying defines this wine that takes a straightforward approach to oak and tannin, integrating them both well. Cherry and cassis linger on the sizable finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah, with smaller amounts of Syrah and Zinfandel. It has edgy tomato leaf scents and moderate acidity, muddling concentrated black and red berry, clove and leather flavors.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dense and massive, this wine is still a baby. It gives it more tannin than fruit at this stage, very concentrated and with a dry, solid core. The fruit is there to feel, a rich m\\u00c3\\u00a9lange of black fruits and firm tannins. This powerful wine needs to age, so don't drink before 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite being nearly six years old, the tannins in this wine are still huge and hard. But the beautiful acidity and the incredibly intense fruity concentration suggests this has more time left to evolve in the bottle. It is the essence of black currant, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis and mineral, focused into a single sip. The wine should start softening around 2018, and continue to evolve well into the 2020s.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Wood aromas along with ripe tropical fruits are the hallmarks of this fully ripe, marvelous wine. It is structured, rich, its fruit given a light cinnamon pinch from the wood. It is so delicious, it could be drunk now, but that would be a shame. Wait until 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Structured and firm, this is a dark chocolate and black fruit-driven wine with solid tannins and enormous density.

Drink through 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The wine is defined by its power and dense concentration. It shows solid black fruits, plums, fig and licorice as well as dark tannins. It seems a little austere at this young stage and needs several years to flesh out.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Flowery and smoky aromas introduce a perfumed, ripe wine. Gentle at first, the tannins gradually show through, part of a solid texture that gives density. Fruit goes from damsons through black cherries and a layer of wild strawberry. For long-term aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There is plenty of the proper power and intensity of a Chambertin here, resulting in a structured wine. It is dense, packed with black plum flavors, with a hard edge of spice and tannin.

Abraxas makes one of the most traditional interpretations with a dark amber color and pure aromas of raisin, dried apricot and chestnut honey.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Structured and concentrated, it has a silky richness that is very Volnay, while at the same time giving the bright fruits of the year. The final tastes are smoke and crisp acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark fruit shows on the palate in this exotically spiced and floral blend from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road. Soft and medium in weight, it has high-toned acidity underneath the brooding spice and forest floor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the top vineyard areas in Pouilly Fum\\u00c3\\u00a9, this wine is rich, concentrated and with a great aging potential. Structured and with yellow fruits superimposed over the crisper, citrus flavors, it's still young and tight. Give this impressive wine until 2019 before drinking.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a satisfying, small-production wine from four rows of the family's Kairos Vineyard, a study in sanguine intensity. Currant, cassis and tar integrate with the body of subtle oak and tannin, finishing in a sprinkling of dried herb and graphite.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and bold, this opens on aromas of ripe wild berry, forest floor, sunbaked earth, leather and grilled herb. The concentrated palate offers fleshy Morello cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, clove and dried herb while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the close but the fruit richness keeps it in check. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas of crushed rock, smoke, ham hock, violets, red fruit and herbs are light but intriguing. The palate is elegant and restrained, coming in waves, with raspberries, smoked meat and mineral. It shows impeccable balance throughout and great length, winning on its subtleties rather than power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Pugnitello and 10% Colorino, this savory, firmly structured wine offers aromas that recall baked plum, prune, resin, blue flower, leather and a balsamic note.

Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Structured, with a juicy backbone of fruit, this full-bodied, 100% varietal wine features aromas of baked bread joined by a taste of blackberry jam. Jolts of cedar and green herb provide a classical touch to the lengthy finish. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, chopped aromatic herb, wild berry and a hint of new leather are the main scent notes. The bright, structured palate is full of layers of juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon, mint and tobacco set against a backbone of chewy tannins. It's already accessible, and while not loaded with complexity, it is delicious. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Chocolaty and spicy, loaded with cinnamon and anise, and backed by sturdy plum-flavored fruit. The mouthfeel is creamy and rich; the finish, long and oaky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aging quietly in 70% new French oak, the 2001 is potentially the winery's finest Cherryblock ever. Crammed with berry fruit and tasting softer and plusher than earlier efforts, if the oak integrates into the wine it may merit an even higher score on release.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The tannins are linear and direct in this otherwise fruity wine. Along with dark tannins, it is also rich with warm red fruits. The acidity still shows strongly and suggests that the wine needs time. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A tribute to the late Angelo Rocca, this delicious wine opens with aromas suggesting leather, truffle, mature black-skinned berry, fragrant blue flower and a whiff of menthol.

Wood aged in new barrels, this wine has a toasty character that is well balanced by the rich fruits. Acidity and a mineral texture give this wine aging potential. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lovely, complex nose of dark fruit, licorice, rose and woodmeal. Delivered the same but in a muted form in the mouth. It seemed to be running out of steam in mid-palate, it came back to post a pleasant and nicely layered finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Many 2000 Barolos are showing signs of retreating into their shells, none more so than this. This was initially very dumb, and only after a good deal of swirling and plenty of time in the glass did it begin to show anything. At last, dark fruit,  earth, rose petal and road tar began to emerge. On the palate it was tannic and again took its time to open, but again it showed some complexity, with a medium finish. A wine that needs a decade in the cellar.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Mid gold color. Slightly muted aromas of ripe stone fruit. Sweet, light to medium-bodied with ample flavors of ripe fruit, peach pie, caramel, apple crisp and soft brown sugar. Fresh, with lively acidity and a smooth texture. Medium length with a sweet, spicy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A fat rich wine with an exuberant personality. Plenty of  hefty, ripe  fruit, a big chunky palate and a good, long luscious finish. While it is not as complex as some other 2003 Barolos, it is friendly and solid and will work beautifully with food.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Giacosa Fratelli (to be distinguished from the venerable house of Bruno Giacosa) tends to make good, solid wines but never anything really earth shattering. This proved to be one of his best, a lovely nose of dark fruit, chocolate, soy and smoked meat. Quite soft on the palate, but rich and layered,and although it showed a touch of mid palate hollowness, the finish was good if somewhat chunky. Needs 3-5 years to really come round.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A new offering from the West Burgundy Wine Group within Jackson Family Wines, this wine hails from the wilds of Annapolis, an extreme outpost of the Sonoma Coast. Spicy cardamom marks the entry, along with plum, dark cherry, cedar and even a hint of grapefruit, the minerality chiseled and clean. Firm tannins mark a lengthy, full-bodied finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is well balanced, ripe and with a good link between the structure and the fragrant, perfumed red berries.

Lean, it finishes with a suggestion of earthy mushroom and savory tea.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crushed violet, baking spice, scorched earth, ripe black-skinned fruit and a whiff of leather meld together on this velvety red.

Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The 4% Petit Verdot in this dark, inky Cabernet Sauvignon is doing its job in terms of color and structure, adding much of both to the mix. Overall the wine is savory and full-bodied on the palate, with bits of spicy clove and sage around black cherry and toasted oak. Enjoy through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a big, hearty wine that opens with aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, truffle, stewed black-skinned fruit and a whiff of menthol.

It's already rather evolved and accessible, with velvety tannins. Drink soon.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Leafy underbrush, scorched earth, baked plum and a whiff of vanilla unfold on this ripe, brawny red. The densely concentrated palate shows dried berry, oak, vanilla and the heat of evident alcohol while close-grained tannins grip the finish. Give the tannins a few years to loosen up then drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and chewy, this starts with aromas of grilled porcini, underbrush, ripe dark fruit, dried herb and clove. Tightly packed tannins frame dried black cherry, prune steeped in spirits, ground pepper and licorice. You'll also feel the heat of evident alcohol on the midpalate that throws it somewhat off-balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toast, oak, coffee, underbrush and baked plum aromas unfold on this extremely ripe, full-bodied wine. The densely concentrated palate delivers blackberry jam, licorice, oak roasted coffee bean, coconut and a vanilla note alongside astringent tannins. Give the tannins another few years to soften then drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Inviting aromas of tobacco, earth, cedar and bacon give weight to racy berry scents. It's stripped and tight as a drum on the palate, with fiery acidity creating tangy raspberry and plum flavors accented by notes of tobacco, wood spice and citrus. This is best enjoyed with food; on its own it's a bit sharp.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gritty on the nose, this has baked bean, mushroom, roasted plum and earth aromas. It feels blocky and tannic, with some cushion to the palate. Oaky tasting, with prune, vanilla and buttery notes that settle on baked fruit and chocolate. It comes on forceful and heavy and is arguably a little overripe.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This offers aromas of candied cherry, cake spice, charred earth, cured meat and a whiff of underbrush. On the rich palate, notes of vanilla and black pepper accent chocolate covered cherry, raspberry and raisin accompanied by velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Definitely on the dry side, showing the tannic face of Pinot Noir. This is a serious wine that reflects its status as a premier cru, a powerful mix of cranberry fruits and dark tannins, but marked by a hot, hard aftertaste.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fruity, dry and immediately appealing, showing ripe raspberry, cherry, blackberry, cola, licorice, bacon and sandalwood flavors. Could use greater complexity, especially at this price. Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah, Syrah and Malbec.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine starts of with intriguing bacon and earth tones that are followed up by rich, ripe raspberry, black cherry, spice, licorice, herb and toast flavors. It's beautifully balanced, with supple tannins and a flashy, robust character that remains enticing and long at the end. Look for more of this varietal from Darioush as its Shiraz vineyards mature.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a powerful statement of ripe Cabernet Sauvignon. It has rich concentrated fruit, with ripe but dry tannins and considerable wood flavors. It is stylish, with layers of acidity and wood complementing the fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Becots, G\\u00c3\\u00a9rard and Dominique, have produced a stylish, modern wine that powers black, sweet fruits through the deceptively soft tannins. Tarry flavors and layers of new wood give the wine a new world character. How long it will last is open to question at this stage. It is certainly developing quickly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From this Calistoga vineyard, a first rate Cabernet, sumptuous and elegant. The fruit straddles an interesting line between herbaceous, green olive notes and riper ones of blackberries. Feels just great in the mouth, plush and sensual. Unquestionably an ager.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth, viscous and velvety on the palate. This is always St. Sup\\u00c3\\u00a9ry's best shot at Cabernet, sporting black currant, blackberry, sage, thyme, coffee and anise flavors. They weave their way along the palate to a long finish. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094J.M.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A modern, smooth wine, with polished fruit and a dark purple color. The wine is full of new wood, but still dominated by liquorice and dark chocolate flavors. It should develop relatively quickly, over the next 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dry-smelling wine, with hints of cinnamon, pine bark, eucalyptus and earth, that unfold slowly on the palate to reveal bright red cherries and berries. It's big and it's structured, yet finishes smooth and silky, blending in coffee and tea notes. Approachable now, but better after 2005.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very new-wood dominated wine, that will appeal to lovers of California Cabernet. Blackcurrant jelly fruits are there as well, very modern, very polished. It is a fine wine, but maybe not Bordeaux.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dried blackberries, tar and pressed purple flowers decorate the extracted nose on this top-end bottling from one of Temecula's shining star producers. Dark chocolate and olallieberries flavor the palate, which is framed by decent tannins and offers vanilla-cookie warmth on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: In its antique bottle, this wine (one of a limited series) is laden with more wood than fruit. It will certainly soften, allowing the black fruits to come through, but this amount of wood will be hard to balance out.

The crisp, dry finish of roasted nuts is attractive but doesn't really linger.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its intense red fruits and acidity, this initially seems so fruity. Slowly the powerful structure comes into play, yielding a concentrated, cellar-worthy wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Charred and smoky on first take, this has plenty of upfront oak that adds a toasty quality to the core plum and berry aromas.

Flavors of chocolate, cherry, plum, tar, resin and licorice are all recognizable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While this is currently firm and closed, it promises fine things to come. Weight and richness combine with a solid core of tannins. The intense, refreshing acidity is a counterpoint to the ripe black-plum flavor.

Textured and ripe, its freshness is a counterpoint to the full fruit flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The tannins are already finely integrated into the rich, ripe fruit. It has a smoky character along with a note of wood spice, and the black plum fruit serves as a juicy underlay. Given its weight and structure, this should for age five years at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tight and compact, this delivers tangy, spicy intensity that's packed around a solid core of red fruit. The midpalate is driven by sensations of cherry, cassis and blackberry, and the finish shows signs of smoky barbecue and roasted chestnut.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tough and gritty now, due to a combination of hard skin and seed tannins and unintegrated new oak.

Try after 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This elegant Brunello opens with a ruby-garnet color and offers enticing aromas of mature berry fruit, cedar, and a touch of cola or tar.

The color, consistency and fruit flavors are all excellent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a bright, buoyant style of Brunello that drinks easily but also delivers the sophistication and complexity you should expect of Montalcino. It opens with crisp, tonic aromas of cassis and wild berry with very subtle aromas of vanilla and toasted nut at the back.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Still young and nervous, this wine needs a few more years of cellar aging.

The solid, monolithic palate offers dried cherry, star anise and coffee alongside velvety tannins.

Intense and full bodied, veering into a leathery texture, it finishes long and ripe, dusted in mocha.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stewed prune, scorched earth, leather, menthol and leafy underbrush aromas set the tone.

Give the tannins another year or two to unfold but drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: French oak, menthol and plum aromas waft out of the glass. The taut, rather light-bodied palate offers tart red cherry, star anise and coffee bean alongside grainy tannins that leave a grippy, astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Too acidic for comfort, with a harsh bite that's almost vinegary. Too bad, because the underlying cherry and cola flavors are just fine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins. Flavors of baked roasted berry fruits are also herbal, green and leafy, while this finishes crisp, raw and tomatoey in flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a good wine, but it relies too much on oak, overwhelming it with buttered toast and caramel. The result is a rich but unbalanced wine, with underlying orange, pineapple and peach flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an oak-driven Brunello that imparts woodshop aromas of spice, toast, mesquite and vanilla. The wine offers loads of intensity in the mouth and gains momentum thanks to its thick, warming texture. Drink it after 2012 to allow time for those oak aromas to mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Off by a few beats from the '02, the '03 shows red currant, plumped raisin and green mint jelly notes.

Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Feral and wild, Spring Hill Vineyard lies in the Petaluma Gap where it is regularly enveloped in fog and cooling coastal winds. The result here is a soft, slightly stemmy, earthy wine with balanced layers of cherry, raspberry and vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of rich, ripe varietal flavor in this dry, tannic young Cabernet. It's strong in blackberries and cassis, with a cedary edge that has the scent of a cigar box. Firm enough to develop some bottle complexity over the next 6 years or so.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from Cabernet Franc, this opens with scents of purple flowers, toasted oak, exotic spice and red currants. The firmly structured palate doles out blackberries, black cherries, ground black pepper, clove, vanilla and mocha alongside velvety tannins.

It's visceral once sipped, with thick jammy blueberry and plum fruits, bloody meats, leather, dark chocolate and coffee grinds.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Another fine proprietary red blend from this producer, this one holds a majority of Cabernet Franc with a sizable proportion of Merlot and smidgen of Cabernet Sauvignon.

The concentrated palate delivers ripe black cherries, blackberries, orange zest, grilled herbs, clove and tobacco, while firm, velvety tannins provide support. A licorice note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine has wood acidity more than fruit freshness, but its citrus and apple flavors show potential. Although spice and toast dominate for the moment, a crisper character comes through at the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Strong wood flavors dominate this wine. While there are hints of the juicy red fruits, the burnt toast is too strong. While that will soften, it seems likely that woodiness will be with the wine a long time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of sawdust, weedy underbrush and a hint of licorice lead the way and carry over to the palate. It lacks fruit richness, and you'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the midpalate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas that recall underbrush, sage, dried tobacco leaf and cherries marinated in spirits. The lean, tannic palate offers coffee and grilled herb but not much fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak, leather, menthol, blue flower and stewed prune aromas lead the way. The tart, taut palate offers dried cherry, raw cranberry, clove and a green note of powdered sage while astringent tannins clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toast, oak, menthol and coconut aromas carry over to the bracing palate along with mocha and mint. It lacks fruit richness while raspy tannins generate an astringent close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Frederick\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a Bordeaux blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 5% Cab Franc and a splash of Petit Verdot\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094is entirely estate-grown, as are all of the Spring Valley wines. Located north of Walla Walla, in rolling wheat country, the vines attain a different set of flavors than anywhere else in the valley. It's an unusual combination of power (15.5% alcohol) and breed. Supple, sleek, mixing its black fruits with streaks of gun metal, iron and pencil lead, this is a wine that wants to tackle a prime rib, mano \\u00c3\\u00a0 mano.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Leafy, earthy aromas of raisin, baked plum and leather are oaky but also a touch green. High acidity creates an upright, juicy mouthfeel, while shrill, acid-driven flavors of plum and berry fruits end with a green reprise as well as flavors of tobacco and citrus peel. This will last a long, long time; drink through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The winery's top-of-the-line Cab, this offers a depth of toasted oak and plum surrounding barbecued meat aromas. Soft and approachable, the fruit is ripe and seasoned by jolts of black pepper on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This estate-grown wine conjures up thoughts of pepper steak in a glass, so spicy and tannic on the palate that it begs for succulent meat with which to pair. Full bodied and roundly soft, its burst of blueberry fruit is juicy and expansive, mellowing on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At 1,100 feet, this high-altitude vineyard yields a crisp and tangy wine.

With lively acidity, it is a bright, fruity wine to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Menthol, blue flower, oak and a whiff of exotic spice emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers raspberry compote, mocha and a hint of cake spice alongside bracing tannins that clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leather, truffle, wild berry and scorched earth aromas take center stage along with toasted oak. The firm, one-dimensional palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin and clove alongside assertive tannins that leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A flagship wine for this producer, this is rich and seductive, opulent even.

Drink this wine from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of balsamic, leather, menthol, crushed herb, blue flower and dark culinary spice unfold on the nose.

Its wood aging is a rich support to this opulent wine with considerable potential. Drink from 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is Burgundian opulence, with generous, rounded black-fruit and -berry flavors. Supporting this richness are the tannins that will allow the wine to age. From Louis Latour Domaine vineyards, it has a solid, dense structure that needs plenty of time. Drink from 2027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Cinnamon and clove aromas stick out on a nose with light red-fruit scents. Power with restraint describes the palate on this varietal Garnacha from old vines. Dark, slightly baked flavors of brandied cherry and mulled berry fruits finish with a touch of oak and a recurrence of lightly baked fruit notes. Drink through 2026.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine from the Corton Grand Cru vineyard is packed with tannins as well as smoky fruit. It is richly structured and firm, yet the fruit is equally powerful, showing bold black fruits struck against bright acidity. The wine will need considerable aging; drink from 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This structured wine comes from one of the lesser-known Grand Crus of Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e. But it does have the structure and density of the wines from this run of grand crus, with bold tannins over the red-cherry fruits. It is likely to be a structured wine for many years. Drink from 2027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aged for a year in new wood barrels, this powerful, concentrated wine shows both richness and considerable aging potential. It is a powerhouse of ripe damson fruits and impressive tannins. Structured and intense, it needs to age for many years. Don't drink before 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and rounded, this softly textured wine has swathes of yellow fruits that are deliciously cut with lime and lemon acidity. The wine, with its touches of toast is balanced, promising a fine future. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hailing from old plantings in the Rocks District, this brings unique sagebrush, violet, blackberry, smoked meat, black pepper and wet stone notes. The palate is exquisitely pure and fresh, with abundant, layered blackberry and kirsch flavors. With its peppery finish and plush mouthfeel, it's swoon-worthy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a rich wine with great potential. Its juicy spice and acidity are balanced with the red fruits, the generous texture and the fine structure. It is a wine that sums up the ripeness of the vintage. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is firm yet ripe, with a bold yet tight character that foreshadows a rich wine in the future. The cherry and red plum flavors are lush and generous. It is going to be a delicious wine, full of concentration.

The fruit offers the weight to counter the tannins. It just needs time. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with native grape Zibibbo, this opens with aromas of sage, tangerine zest and Mediterranean herb. The aromas follow through to the lively palate alongside brisk acidity and a saline note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made for Fleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar, this bottling is the winery's first release from this vineyard, set near the town of Petaluma. The barrel imprint is significant, rounded out by plum, earthy mushroom, fennel and ripe strawberry. Brooding, this wine offers a dark and dense underbelly of bittersweet chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of chocolate, licorice and ripe red berry that carry over to the straightforward, jammy palate along with espresso and a toasted note. Astringent tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Too soft and sugary sweet for a dry table wine, although the cherry, blackberry and chocolate flavors are decadently delicious. Needs dryness and greater structural integrity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Flavors of ripe blackberry, cola and mulberry stand out in this dry, elegant Cab. The tannins are thick but the wine isn't likely to improve with age, so drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hailing from a hot, dry year, this single-vineyard Rioja smells grapy and like cassis and fresh herbs. In the mouth, it's loud on the attack but doesn't sport the structure of previous vintages. Short black-fruit flavors pick up complexity and depth with airing, but a quiet, jammy finish confirms that this is up to par but not one of Artadi's standout wines. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a muted, age-worthy and densely concentrated wine, with small amounts of Merlot, Syrah and Petit Verdot blended in, given almost two years in French oak, 75% of it new. The vineyard is on Howell Mountain and the imprint of mountain blackberry, black plum and dark chocolate is strong, with a touch of vanilla on the finish. Cellar through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With such pedigreed names as winemaker Aaron Pott and viticulturalist David Abreu, Bello's owners spared no expense in crafting this Cabernet. The result, while rich, is unexciting. It has ripe, flashy flavors of blackberries, cherries and new French oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made predominantly from Sangiovese with 8% Canaiolo, this wine begins with aromas of toasted oak, spice, mature black berries and just a whiff of rubber. The palate offers black cherry, white and red pepper, espresso and roasted coffee bean alongside youthful, astringent tannins that need a few years to unwind.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subdued aromas of dried berry, toasted oak and scorched earth eventually emerge in the glass. A blend of Sangiovese, Colorino and Cabernet Sauvignon, the palate offers dried black cherry, anise, tobacco and roasted coffee bean alongside ample tannins. The fruit is starting to dry up, so don't hold on to this too long.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Merlot-heavy blend adds an additional 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Malbec to its mix, all from a single vineyard high atop Sonoma Mountain. Dill, cucumber and cranberry combine intriguingly, before a core of juicy acidity adds buoyancy to the mix.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with organically cultivated grapes, this opens with aromas that recall game, scorched earth, leather, grilled herb and a whiff of barnyard. The dense, concentrated palate delivers mature black cherry, plum, mocha and a confectionary note alongside round tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With subtle wood aging, this is a smooth wine that has hints of toast over its delicious white and apricot fruits. Orange zest tang gives a delicious bite and texture, suggesting how well the wine will age. Drink this fruity wine from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, game, scorched earth and exotic spice lead the nose. The tight palate offers dried black fruit, toasted oak, roasted coffee bean, grilled sage and a smoky note alongside extremely astringent tannins that dry out the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Open and flattering, as are many of the 2000s, showing a dose of smoky, toasty oak layered over buttered nuts, honey and peach. Turns more citrusy on the finish, with tangerine and mineral notes lingering gently. Quite oaky, but has the depth of fruit to support it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Flavio Fanti's tiny 12-acre vineyard is treated almost like his backyard, with a scrupulous attention to detail and now a dense planting that has definitely improved the quality of the wines. The 1997 shows modern, spicy wood, violet and rose aromas. The palate is rich, firm and dry, but with attractive bitter chocolate and licorice flavors. The new wood shows through but never throws the wine off balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: If you prefer older-style Brunello with its firm tannins and solid backbone of dry fruit, then this is the one for you. Aromas of wild cherries and chocolate are followed on the palate by powerful, brooding fruit and a solid structure on the palate. It leaves a dry aftertaste that should pair well with rich foods. Cellar for at least 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Musclebound with an earthy, spicy character to the nose. The body is fleshy but pure, offering black cherry flavors accented by tar and licorice. It finishes smooth, with just the right touch of vanilla oak. It's a polished Brunello, good for near-term drinking, but also a candidate for the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, Porcini mushroom and a hint of toast emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, star anise and mocha alongside assertive tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggesting dried rose petal, woodland berry, chopped mint and kitchen spice come together on this. The tight palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose, offering sour cherry, tart cranberry and a hint of clove alongside bracing tannins that grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of oak, toast and espresso that carry over to the firmly structured palate along with herb and dried black cherry. Austere tannins clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This rich wine is full and has a good balance of acidity and fruit. The lightly mineral texture gives bite and crispness. It is still a young, tight wine needing another few months. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, camphor, balsamic notes, game, French oak and oak-driven spice lead the nose. The tight, firmly structured palate shows oak, mature plum, baked fruit and a hint of vanilla alongside assertive, grainy tannin that dry out the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Camphor, menthol, toast and espresso aromas lead the nose. The firm, tightly wound palate shows roasted coffee bean, dried cherry and licorice alongside bracing tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toast, sawdust, raspberry jam and menthol lead the way. The firm palate offers cherry liqueur, espresso and a hint of licorice while close-grained tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is initially very closed and a little funky, but it soon opens up in the glass to reveal ripe black-skinned fruit, raisin and a whiff of kitchen spice. On the solid, no-frills palate, notes of fig and grilled sage back up a core of dried black cherry while close-grained grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 2009 Dollarhide Petit Verdot is an excellent wine that reflects its terroir, but overall it's a tad one dimensional, with a dark color, strong tannins and ripe, sweet blackberry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a refreshing, lemon-flavored wine. Attractive crispness comes out of the mineral texture and perfumed acidity. Light and still young, this will age to be ready to drink from late 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Initially closed, this eventually reveals subdued aromas of scorched earth, leather, overripe berry, a hint of sage and a whiff of cured meat. The bracing palate offers raisin, licorice and a note of dried black cherry while raspy tannins leave and astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of two vineyards, Pratt Vine Hill Road and Gap's Crown, enviable sources for both red and white grapes. The end result here shines in honey and a sublime hint of lemon candy. Bright, floral acidity lines a foundation of fresh tangerine and lime, finishing with an intensity of salty, spiced oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the winery's Bordeaux study series, this Merlot-based blend shows roast beef, smoke, lilac, violet, lavender and shy black-cherry fruit on the nose. There's more fruit on the palate, with blackberry paste. However, the rigid tannins don't open up easily. Notes of crushed volcanic rock, espresso, dried herbs and leather are subtle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enviable structure marks this lovely wine that appears to have been made in a slightly reductive style. Light oak, a bouquet of dried herb and vanilla ride along a medium-bodied texture that's soft and silky, with a panache of juicy blackberry and currant on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Flat aromas of coconut and toasted oak give way to smoky chocolate mocha, red currant and black pepper. A touch soft on the finish, it otherwise drinks full-bodied and powerful.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A vibrant yellow-gold color and a good blend of delicate citrus and butter in the aroma and flavor give this understated and medium-bodied wine the balance and interest to satisfy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leathery, clipped, briary black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked and smoky. This feels like a bag of nails, with a sucking texture. Barrel-heavy flavors of charred blackberry and cassis are resiny and dry, with clove notes and pounding tannins. Hold as long as you wish; this can only benefit from more time in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is ripe with generous strawberry flavors and perfumed acidity. A smoky edge accompanies tastes of red cherry. The wine is rounded and light with attractive final acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a rich, soft wine with jammy black fruits and ripe tannins. The acidity will hold the wine together and allow it to age. A mineral edge comes from the caillou (stones) in the soil\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094hence the wine's name. It will age, although quickly, so drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a very good wine in here, but the winery has released it far too early, which shifts the burden of cellaring to the buyer. Right now it's all primary fruit, acidity and oak. But the fruit is beautifully layered in tiers of roasted blackberries, grilled cherries and cola, and the oak is splendid. This dry, silky wine desperately needs to be held until at least late 2010, and should drink well through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful Cabernet, made in an elegantly approachable way. Dry and smooth, it shows complex flavors of blackberries, currants and dried herbs, wrapped into rich, dusty tannins. The alcohol level is quite high, but balanced, in a California way.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Medicinal and saline aromas lead the nose. The medicinal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094almost chemical\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094sensation carries over to the lean palate while raspy tannins leave a grainy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rustic aromas of barnyard, game and overripe fruit follow through to the brawny palate along with powdered sage, violet and a hint of game. Full-bodied but lacking fruit richness, it and ends on a bitter note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crushed violet, iris, spiced plum and raisin aromas come together on this. The structured palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry jam, licorice and nutmeg alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. It closes on a note of roasted coffee bean.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Aegerter's own vineyards, this is an initially soft wine. It's only when the background tannins kick in that it becomes firmer, giving a dry, still-young core to this ripe wine. Red fruits dominate, balanced by acidity and a stylish, while firm, aftertaste. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wild berry, grilled herb, violet and rose aromas come together in the glass. The full-bodied, savory palate doles out ripe, red cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, sage and mocha accompanied by velvety tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage. An orange zest note bolsters the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing scents of wild rose, violet, perfumed berry and a whiff of aromatic herb unfold on this full-bodied red. The firm palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper, clove and anise framed in assertive but ripe tannins and fresh acidity. Better after 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is made to highlight the vintage and best vineyards, relying heavily on the producer's top-end site, Sacrashe. A hugely constructed wine, bold and brawny, it also manages to be soft and velvety, allowing for a greater contribution of savory elements than sweet, from leather to black pepper to Mexican chocolate. It pushes the boundaries on decadence in mysterious ways.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Fragrant and perfumed, this wine is the epitome of great Cabernet Sauvignon. It is fruity, juicy yet with serious concentrated tannins. There is spice from the wood aging along with a dash of pepper, all the while just bringing out the beautiful black-currant flavors. Drink this wine from 2024\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine employs 73% Spottswoode Estate Vineyard fruit, but also ventures to other sites, including Young Inglewood, Oakville Ranch and Darms Lane. Dusty cedar, blackberry and pencil shavings dot a structured, classically stylized landscape, additionally seasoned in black pepper and clove. It has length for miles; enjoy best 2023 through 2033.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Extremely ripe aromas of prune, blackberry, cassis and cinnamon announce a jammy loaded palate that weighs nothing short of a ton. The flavor profile is a black-fruit bonanza accented by graphite and blackened toast.

Fully tannic, with toasty chocolaty flavors of black fruits and oak-based spice, this finishes full and fierce, but not mean. Drink from 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is made from the same barrels as the producer's Finch Hollow offering, using the wine from the top of the barrels and left unfined and unfiltered. The result is an ethereal experience, creamy and crisp in golden apple and nectarine, its body rich, round, lush and delightfully satisfying.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just under three-quarters of this wine with the balance Syrah. A blend of fruit from River Rock and Jack's vineyards, it's aromatically reserved, with notes of flowers, green herb, cherry and moist earth. The tart fruit flavors are silky and full in feel, bringing a lovely sense of presence to the mixture of fruit and savory flavors. The finish lingers.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Smoky blackberry, black cherry and leather ride a wave of sumptuous, soft and seamless texture in this lovely wine, blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Focused acidity buoys the fruit of this full-bodied wine, structured and luxurious in a finish of chocolate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Velvety, lush and bright, this wine celebrates a warm, wonderful vintage in its exuberance of clove, currant and chocolate-covered cherry, yet the acidity is focused and tense. Lengthy and built to last, the rounded palate is seasoned in black pepper.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The producer packs a powerful punch into this blend of 72% Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Cabernet Franc, aged two years in 70% new French oak. Big, hearty tannins wrap around curls of smoked meat, clove, sage and black pepper, finding common purpose in layered complexity. It should be best between 2022 and 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is concentrated with tannins that come from both the firm fruit and the wood aging. It is packed with blackberry flavors that come through the structure strongly. The velvet texture (that is just a hint at the moment) is going to bring out the richness of this wine produced with consultation from Michel Rolland. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This study of darkness that puts 76% Petite Sirah together with 16% Tannat and 8% Tempranillo shows blackcurrant, brown sugar, scarlet-red roses and herb-crusted roast beef on the nose. Ripe olallieberries and dark meat flavors show on the sip, where soft but grippy tannins are laced with spicy acidity and crushed herbs.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of blackberry, dark spices and herbs are intriguing but oaky and closed right now. An intense, tannic, drawing palate is home to coffee and smoky dark-berry flavors. A massive, highly tannic finish tastes of espresso, bitter chocolate, savory berry and plum.

It's elegantly styled with light blue-fruit flavors, at times seeming a bit faint.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggest stewed plum, grilled herb and mint.

The palate displays baked plum, black pepper and anisette alongside bracing tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Powerful tannins give this wine its dense, concentrated character. It is dark and dense, very dry at this stage and needing at least 10 years to round itself out. However, the presence of fruit promises a good future.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grown in Calistoga, this is textbook Petite Sirah: It's black as a moonless night, bone dry, intensely tannic and enormously packed in fruit. Those tannins really lock the wine down in astringency, but they can't hide the massive burst of blackberry, cassis liqueur, mocha, crispy bacon and black pepper. Nowhere near ready to drink, it's a wine to be cellared for 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years, at the very least. It should glide through the decades effortlessly, gradually losing tannins and growing more clean and pure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of scorched soil, toasted hazelnut, dried black cherry and an earthy whiff of game carry over to the palate along with a note of bitter sage. Firm tannins provide support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toast and licorice lead the nose along with a hint of roasted coffee bean.

It lacks fruit richness while bracing tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wonderfully firm, concentrated wine that walks a fine, balanced line between richness and poised structure. It is classic in the best sense, showing all the shape of a fine Bordeaux, while adding the extra dimension of the freshest of black fruits, complexity from a few hints of wood, and a dark, brooding, long-lasting aftertaste.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Impressively dense, dark flavored wine, very rich and quite extracted. But it still keeps the elegance and some of the freshness of 2004, and there is plenty of blackberry flavor to push the wine along. Heavier than many 2004s, it still shows that great acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is massive, hugely concentrated, topped with wood and intense tannins.

More time in bottle should help make friends of the disparate elements; drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The first Merlot offering from this producer, this is 100% varietal and totally full-throttle in its fleshy components of vanilla and chocolate, seasoned in cinnamon. Fresh and somewhat floral, it's bright despite its size and lively on the palate. The wine is made in tiny amounts.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This soft and approachable Merlot brims in smoke and oak, with subtle plum fruit. A slight layering of spice on the back of the palate is pleasing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a soft, well-crafted wine from the eastern side of St. Helena that's both classic in its dried herb, tobacco and tea aromas and fruity with red currant and cranberry notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, underbrush and a balsamic note take shape in the glass.

It could be a phase, or it could be a failing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a delicious wine already, not powerful, but charming and elegant.

Although rough and rugged now, this should improve little by little through about 2030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a full-bodied, densely packed and muscular wine, concentrated in tar, chocolate, leather and tobacco leaf.

Mild tannin and a robustness of ripe black currant and cedar are seasoned in a strong whiplash of eucalyptus, as the finish touches a theme of black tea.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A subdued nose slowly reveals underbrush, clove, new leather and balsamic aromas.

Few wineries in California accomplish this as regularly as Hanzell, and here they come again, with this wonderful 2008. It's entirely consistent with their past history, being dry, a little tannic and tantalizingly rich in cherry, raspberry and cola fruit. Enjoyable now, with decanting, and should develop in the cellar over the next dozen years if not longer, based on the winery's track record.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This inky wine opens with black concentration and rich aromas of mature cherry, almond paste, spice, blackberry and plum.

Drink over the next few years with flavorful pork dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This internationally-styled Barbera shows aromas of oak, ground coffee bean and smoke as well as black fruit. While the palate is dense with ripe black-cherry, chocolate and vanilla flavors, oak dominates, and astringent wood tannins dry out the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mainly Syrah, with lesser amounts of Grenache and Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, this is a very soft, sweet, fruity wine. It tastes like a dried raspberry, milk chocolate, brown sugar and nougat candy confection, with enormously high alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows ripe prune and oak aromas and hints of burnt rubber and smoke. The palate shows very ripe black fruit, espresso and a warm midpalate. This wine shows some green notes and finishes with bitter, astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas and palate of this wine are dominated by oak. This sparkling wine also shows flavors of toast and vanilla, with subtle hints of butterscotch and lemon drop. It finishes on a bitter-walnut note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This sparkling ros\\u00c3\\u00a9 has a floral fragrance and nutty undertones. The palate isn't very expressive, but reveals subdued strawberry and spice notes. It has a refined perlage and finishes on a dry, walnut note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Complex aromas of cassis, dough, espresso, bacon, and cola create instant interest. It seduces with its rich dark fruit and earth flavors, and a concentrated, suave mouthfeel. Big flavors and tannins don't quit on the long, even finish. Profoundly enjoyable, seamless and shows impeccable balance. Keep for five to seven years; it will last a long time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forward aromas of ripe cherries and deep vanillin oak meld nicely. Black plum, sweet cherry and coffee flavors, with cedar accents. The very full, supple mouthfeel is captivating. Shows fine length, spicy dry tannins and the stuffing to last. Hold four or more years, as it will keep for ages.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Chocolate-covered cherry and plum surround a shock of stark acidity on this wine that has a round and soft palate. On the finish, a touch of astringency flirts with cedar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is made from a duet of vineyards otherwise single-bottle designated: Cloud's Nest on Mount Veeder and Haystack from Atlas Peak. Smooth, rounded and rich in blackberry and raspberry, with a touch of currant, it has a woody, lasting taste of tannin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heavy prune and raisin aromas are perfumed and rich, but arguably a bit overripe. Matching the nose, this feels thick, saturated and grapy. Flavors of black plum and blueberry finish chunky, with muscularity but also a rubbery flavor note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black cherry and cassis aromas are bold but basic. This feels fiercely tannic and astringent. Meaty flavors of cherry and black plum end with dried berry notes, prune and rock-hard tannic bite. Give this more time if possible, but like many 2013s it might never soften and improve.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This seven-acre Petit family estate is dominated by Merlot that gives the wine its rich generous character. In this vintage it was balanced by crisp acidity and a lively aftertaste. The tannins promise further aging. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coming off The Rocks District, this wine displays somewhat reserved notes of ember, smoked meat, green olive, wet stone and smoke, leaning hard into the savory. The charcuterie, smoke and licorice flavors coat the palate, stretching out on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This ranks among the producer's biggest, boldest and most luxurious wines, a celebration of all that the appellation can offer in a stellar vintage. Integrated tannins provide structure without distraction, while layers of red berry, currant and leather combine for a dry, ripe and rewarding mouthfeel. This should be best between 2023 and 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in a tighter, drier, lower alcohol style, this Cab shows a precision and control that riper, more opulent Cabs seldom display. It's also quite food-friendly. That's not a slap, it's a compliment. You'll find classic blackberry and currant flavors layered with oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is fairly austere in taste, restrained in oak on the front palate before offering thick tannin structure on the back palate and finish. In between, expect cranberry, raspberry and clove to compete for affection, integrating well with one another.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful wine that has the character of a modern, ripe, cult-style wine, but maintains balance and elegance. The black currant and cedar flavors are enormously satisfying, while the wine is entirely dry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vibrant, fruity and dry now, with savory black currant, red currant, plum and cherry flavors, this Cab also has a spicy, minty quality that makes it come alive on the palate. It's young and tannic, and will benefit from up to eight years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine was sourced from three vineyards, including Gap's Crown atop what may one day be officially known as the Petaluma Gap, and the estate property known as Last Stop Ranch. It offers a mix of smoky charcuterie alongside tart cherry and cranberry, a balance of savory and sweet. Lightly textured and bodied, it finishes in piquant cinnamon spice and ginger.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Reserved on the nose, with tight citrus blossom and a wet stone minerality, this blend of Roussanne and Viognier by the Paso-residing French couple Guillaume and Sol\\u00c3\\u00a8ne Fabre will drink fresh for years to come. The palate is framed by pithy tension, with flavors of apple skin, pear flesh and a tingle of acidity deep into the finish. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Valmur brings out great richness from the vineyard and the vintage while keeping an intense texture, orange zest and grapefruit flavors and a firm butter and toast aftertaste. Age for four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Credit this Merlot for sheer enjoyability. It defines Merlot as the soft, drink-me-now Bordeaux red wine, full-bodied yet instantly likeable. Made from 100% Merlot, it's extraordinairly rich in cherry fruit, while 100% new French oak adds a deft touch of buttered toast. The tannins are gentle, sweet and complex. This flashy, fleshy wine is great now, and will hold and evolve in the bottle for at least six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Bordeaux-style blend, from a choice section of the Seven Hills Vineyard, is fragrant with a beguiling mix of fruits, flowers and fresh herbs. Cassis and pepper, Asian spices and a lingering, textural mouthfeel, make this a wine that disappears all too quickly from the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the tiny island of Salina off the north coast of Sicily (where the Tasca family runs a beautiful boutique hotel called Capofaro), comes this excellent expression of Malvasia. This dessert wine shows exactly what this versatile white grape variety is built to do best: The bouquet is redolent of honey, golden vanilla cream, candied apricot and sweet almond marzipan.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mille e Una Notte is one of a handful of wines that defines the very best of Sicilian enology. Dark, luscious and penetrating, this sophisticated red blend shows deep layers of chocolate, cherry liqueur, dried sage, tobacco and leather. It's soft and silky rich on the long, delicious finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The vintage as well as the vineyard gave this hugely rich wine. It has weight, concentrated fruit and toast flavors, the acidity on line right through the center. Peach, pineapple and grapefruit combine to give an impressive, textured fruitiness. Age for 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Presenting at first as somewhat reduced, this wine is tart and feral, with a muskiness reminiscent of mushroom and forest floor. Its intensely voluptuous body is concentrated in black cherry, cola and cardamom, with a richness and roundness on the palate and finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sharp mineral and vitamin notes are not inviting when considered individually but they do form a good frame to chewy blueberry muffin, cherry-pie and earthy aromas. It's probably better to drink this wine sooner rather than later before the mineral tones become too prominent.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Although this wine opens with a lively ruby color, it segues into tired, somewhat lifeless aromas of resin, tar, cherry liquor, earth and deep toasted notes. The wine seems to be very influenced by the wood it aged in.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a sugary sweetness to this Pinot Noir and Chardonnay blend, in roughly equal measures. It's rich and ripe in raspberries, limes and oranges, with the doughy, leesy sourness that marks a good sparkling wine. Feels somewhat rough and aggressive now, but elegant and complex. Could develop bottle complexity over this decade.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a Bordeaux-style blend based on the two Cabernets, Sauvignon and Franc. It's made in the modern style, soft, ripe and oaky. Floods the mouth with black cherry and raspberry flavors, sweetened with caramelized oak, and undeniably delicious. However, a combination of high alcohol and excessive softness seems to limit ageability, so enjoy over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: So ripe, it's like drinking the Platonic essence of cherries and blackberries, sweet and satisfying in fruity richness. Oak adds the usual level of flashy toast. It's a little on the soft side, but dramatically layered. Hard to tell where it's going down the road, so drink over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Clos Windsbuhl in Hunawihr is the northernmost of Zind-Humbrecht's collection of vineyards. In 2012, it has produced an impressive wine that has all the right spice of Pinot Gris along with acidity and a fresh edge. That gives this rich wine a great lift, with a waft of pear to go with the yellow-fruit flavors. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy red berry, brimstone, leather, licorice, mint and thyme are just some of the aromas and flavors of this powerfully structured wine. Despite the muscular build, it's also loaded with finesse, boasting firm but noble tannins that accompany the layers of savory flavors. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dense and full-bodied, this delivers sensations of asphalt, menthol, grilled herb, mature black cherry and game. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's ripe and forward but firmly knit tannins give it a solid backbone that will allow it to age for several more years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From the winery's most pebbly five-acre section of vineyard atop Diamond Mountain, this is dark black-purple in color. The tannins are soft but powerful, eager to age through 2025\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027, while the fruit lies on the currant and plum side of things, with a bit of cedar lurking through.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Leather, truffle, black cherry, grilled herb and a whiff of mocha lead the nose on this structured but straightforward wine. The palate is still rather closed but delivers crushed red cherry, white pepper and grilled herb alongside fresh acidity and young, raspy tannins that need time to soften. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Restrained in new oak, this refined wine has a floral honeysuckle character that's followed by hearty, rich layers of apple and melon. Just a touch of licorice and orange zest appears on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured wine features an enticing fragrance of red rose petal, blue flower and a whiff of crushed red berry. The robust palate delivers juicy black cherry layered with notes of spice, vanilla, tobacco and anisette alongside firm tannins that need time to unfold.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the well-known Zinfandel producer, this floral Chardonnay is high in balanced minerality and marked by darker, riper pear and apple fruit. The finish is swathed in vanilla bean and toast.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: You can tell a Dal Forno wine a mile away thanks to the overall intensity and concentration of his well-crafted blends. Three years of oak aging has shaped aromas of Spanish cedar, chocolate, cola, blackberry jam and cherry liqueur. The wine is so thick, it moves like molasses in the glass.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tastes fairly straightforward now, with fresh, vigorous blackberry, blueberry, cherry, anise and mocha flavors that have a minerally bite. The tannins are tough, gritty and dry, as befits a young Cabernet grown on Diamond Mountain. Needs time, and lots of it. Hold until after 2016, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's impressive how much honey flavor laced with lemon acidity there is in this wine. The pairing gives the sweetness a wonderful focus, coming to a point of freshness, leaving a delicious, lifted aftertaste. Age for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As delicious as Pinot Noir gets, this has fireworks of raspberries, cherries and cola, and a sweet, mushroom-like essence of earth. Then the depth kicks in. It's not a big, tannic wine, but rather soft, with enormous charm and immediate appeal. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Closed-up at present, this aromatic brooder has notes of red and black fruit, scorched earth and herbs, along with a floral top note. It has a mountain-fruit profile of firm, chewy tannins, tart acids and dense flavors. Time in the cellar is required to fully appreciate it. Let it be until at least 2020 but it should have a good 15 years beyond that.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Floral and soft, with a substantial foundation of leather and black licorice, this is a tremendously seductive wine, layered and complex, with years to go in terms of structure. Already it offers velvety tannins and dreams of blackberry patches gone by, finishing with succulence and a taste of pure dark chocolate. Cellar through 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Charred, smoky aromas of blackberry are ripe as can be, with a note of graphite. The palate is huge, polished, pure and ideal if you like ripe, modern Rioja. Flavors of toast, blackberry, spice and mocha finish toasty, with strong notes of pepper and coffee. Drink this smooth, silky single-vineyard Rioja through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pressed rose, dark berry, baked earth, forest floor, licorice, walnut and a balsamic note are some of the intriguing aromas you'll find on this fantastic, balanced Barolo. The structured, elegant palate delivers mature black cherry, dark raspberry, anise, white pepper, tobacco, orange peel and clove alongside assertive but refined tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe plum, mature black cherry, violet, clove, mocha, anise and grilled sage are just some of the sensations you'll find on this gorgeous wine alongside velvety tannins. It already has great depth but hold for more complexity. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Garc\\u00c3\\u00ada Figuero had a great year in 2010, as did many high-end Ribera del Duero wineries. This reserva is heady up front, with malty aromas of vanilla, barrel resin, tobacco, blackberry and cassis. This is huge but holds onto its balance, while flavors of baked black fruits come with vanilla, coffee, mocha and chocolate accents. This modern marvel finishes with vanilla, pepper and chocolate flavors on top of lasting black currant and blackberry. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of rose, violet, mature berry and a whiff of leather lead the way on this structured red. The full-bodied palate offers layers of dried black cherry, leather, tobacco and grilled herbs, supported by a backbone of firm, ripe tannins. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thinly textured and light red in color, this Pinot is lean and very much in display of rustic, earthy aromas and flavors.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Inviting aromas of black berry, spice, leather, truffle and a whiff of toasted oak lead the nose. The palate opens with flavors that include black cherry, baking spices, herbs, black pepper and espresso. Drying wood tannins give an astringent and abrupt finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leather, berry, toast, crushed rose and herbs are some of the scents that emerge. The palate displays crushed cherry, black pepper, licorice and balsamic notes alongside youthfully aggressive, tightly packed tannins that need another few years to unwind.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 75% Syrah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is somewhat unformed, with notions of black olive and garrigue suggested but never quite committed to. The finish is lean and diluted.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Preponderant green, herbal aroma and flavor marks this wine. The mix of pencil lead and a smoky char never really make friends.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine has red fruits and spice from wood aging. It suffers from the lean character of the vintage, giving a wine that shows tannins while not having enough fruitiness. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of nail-polish remover and oak-driven spice that carry over to the palate while raspy tannins leave an astringent, mouth drying finish. Tried both bottles and had the same notes.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Graphite, maple and other oaky aromas dominate this lush, pitch-black Tinto Fino. A chewy, dense mouthfeel is rich as an oil baron, while oak-driven flavors of vanilla and baking spices accent blackberry and cassis. On the finish, this is monster-sized and full of blue-fruit deliciousness. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brambly red cherry and strawberry are featured among shy layers of oak, providing the wine with an interesting duality of power and silkiness on the palate. A complex streak of minerality makes this intriguingly seductive and exotic, with layers of flavor unfolding with each sip.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dark and dense, this is sourced from the winery's own Sacrashe property in the hillsides of Rutherford, as well as Bergfeld Vineyard. The wine has a concentrated and jammy quality that doesn't step over the edge. It offers anise, blackberry, black currant and dried herb around a soft, rounded mouthfeel and long finish. Enjoy 2021\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The fruit came from the Glenrose Vineyard and underwent a 30-day maceration before spending three years in puncheon. The wonderful nose shows chocolate-covered dried cherries, stewed plum, sweetened leather and an almost teriyaki umami. The palate is framed by silky, fine-grained tannins with acidity that's still fresh, along with roasted game, cooked cherry and more tanned leather flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 80-year old Nerello Mascalese vines, this powerfully structured wine features aromas of ripe berry, allspice, anise and Mediterranean herb. The concentrated, warm palate offers ripe black cherry, raspberry, licorice, mineral and white pepper alongside the warmth of alcohol and firm, velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spanish broom, dried lychee, aromatic Mediterranean herb and balsamic notes are just some of the aromas of this multifaceted wine. The linear palate shows compelling depth, delivering layers of mature yellow apple, Bartlett pear, thyme, salvia and energizing mineral alongside still-bright acidity. This wine could go on for another several years at least. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Wiebelsberg Grand Cru is in Andlau in the north of Alsace. Its terroir, influenced by rocks from the Vosges mountains, gives a strong minerality to this wine. It has structure, a dry heart surrounded by ripe, generous fruits. As any Grand Cru, it needs to age, so drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While showing sweetness, this wine also manages to retain great freshness. It's delicious, with bright green plum fruitiness as well as weight and richness. It will be a great food wine, but wait until 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of bread crust, oak and summer orchard lift out of the glass. The mature, concentrated palate offers citrus zest, mature apple, toasted hazelnut and a yeasty note alongside a firm but refined perlage. A bitter almond note closes the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A complex name for this finely crafted wine. It shows green fruits and oak, some intensity of flavor and a great layer of acidity, cutting through the rich fruits. The finish brings all this acidity forward, giving a classic Chablis minerality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Textured wine, the crisp white fruits are tight against acidity and spice. It fills the mouth, broadening into a wine that becomes creamy, with wood and green plum skins giving structure. This is another example of how a lesser appellation can shine at the hands of a master vigneron.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is not your standard Cerasuolo di Vittoria by any stretch. The wine exhibits dark concentration and plush aromas of blackberry and sweet almond thanks to 18 months of oak aging. This is a fuller and denser expression of what is usually a light and compact wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sigillo offers good density and concentration that follows refined aromas of berry fruit and white mineral. The wine has elegance, harmony and tastes filling but fresh in the mouth. It is a 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Nero d'Avola.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This unusual wine, from Dunham's estate vineyard, is dark and shows Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne-like flavors of blood and cured meats. The fruit is tart\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094wild berry and cranberry flavors just on the edge of herbal, but laden with grace notes of herb, mineral and coffee. It's a pleasure to taste a Washington Syrah with this complexity at a very French (13%) level of alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and it brims with varietal notes of dryness, strong tannins and black currant and dark chocolate flavors. It's still shut down, almost undrinkable for the hardness. But it could age well. Begin investigating it in 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The best way to understand this wine is to consider a fine Pinot Noir, with its light, silky texture and brisk acidity. Then make it very tannic, and add a smoked meat, bacon note to the cherries and raspberries. With a dry, distinguished finish, it strongly suggests beef dishes, preferably augmented with cheese.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a single parcel in Meursault, this is a tight and structured wine. It has strong minerality as well as spice and vanilla from wood aging. The zesty white and citrus fruits are still developing, giving a wine that will age well. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With a fine balance between some rigorous tannins and a more generous black-fruit character, this is a wine both to appreciate now and to age. The wine is perfumed, with spice from the wood aging and mint and thyme aromas. This serious wine is just ready to drink, but that would be a shame, so wait until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is part of a collection of wines from old vine parcels put together by Nicolas Potel. The wine comes from vines up to 62-years-old, that are rich in opulent fruitiness which is shot through with acidity. Wood aging has added a toasty character without losing any sight of the fruit. It is a fine wine that should age further. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of plum jam, blackberry extract and dark baking spice lead the nose.

Fresh acidity lifts the rich flavors while notes of raisin and exotic spice close the firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing scents of exotic spice, baked plum and crushed blue flower float out of the glass. The round full-bodied palate delivers dried morello cherry, raspberry jam, star anise and a hint of pipe tobacco. Velvety tannins provide support and lend finesse.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This 90th anniversary edition boasts enticing aromas of baked plum, crushed violet, new leather, French oak and a whiff of pipe tobacco. The firm concentrated palate presents layers of dried blackberry, black cherry extract, licorice and cake spice framed in assertive fine-grained tannins. Give it a few more years to fully develop. Drink through 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From fruit grown in Carneros, 74% of it Chardonnay and 26% Pinot Noir, this includes grapes from both Hudson and Hyde vineyards. Gorgeously full bodied and elegant, it's dry on the palate with vibrant acidity to balance the tangy flavors of cherry, pomegranate and cranberry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is a blend of Merlot (45%), Cabernet Franc (34%), Petit Verdot (8%), Malbec (8%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Brooding aromas of green herbs, flowers and cherry lead to a ripe full-flavored palate that shows a fine sense of balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a lovely interpretation of Barbera Superiore from Asti with extremely well-integrated notes of spice, chocolate, black fruit and dusty mineral. The wine has all the aromas you look for in this type of wine and delivers a very clean and polished feel in the mouth with subtle hints of toasted oak at the very end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a wine that opens beautifully to all your senses. It boasts a dense, vibrant ruby color and delivers bright aromas of cherry, blackberry and bitter cranberry. In the mouth, however, this wine is softer and plusher than you'd expect. Sure, that trademark Barbera acidity is present, but its natural sharpness has been dulled.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sineann has a stellar record with Cabs from Oregon and Washington State. Now they're making a Napa Cab, from a tiny vineyard in the Oak Knoll District. They've brought their Bordeaux-inspired vision to California, producing a structured wine brimming with tannins and acids, yet with rewarding currant, mocha and smoky oak flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a Cabernet producer to keep your eyes on. The winemaker is Kian Tavakoli, who earned his stripes at Opus One and Clos du Val. The wine is sourced from three top vineyards, including To Kalon. It's a very ambitious effort, one that defines great Napa Cab. Softly tannic now in its youth, the blackberry, currant and smoky oak flavors are delicious and complex, offering waves of ever-changing nuances. Should develop well for several years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Classic Sauternes, treading the fine line between sweetness and elegance. Initially, it seems to be dominated by the botrytis, but then sweet fruits also show, with ripe yellow fruits, honey and almonds, touched with citrus. As it develops, the wine will become richer and more intense.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coronato is a robust, modern super Tuscan only produced for export markets. Indeed, you can sense a New World appeal within its rich, succulent fabric thanks to penetrating notes of coffee, espresso, tar, aniseed, chocolate and bursting cherry.

It's soft and lush and certainly does not lack power or concentration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thick, dark concentration sets the tone, but elegance and harmony are achieved thanks to delicate mineral and balsam notes that add buoyancy and personality. This is a wine that speaks volumes about its Tuscan territory and you can almost taste that sun-drenched, chalky minerality sucked up through the vines' roots.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a good example of Syrah's potential in Tuscany, giving off generous notes of bright cherry and boysenberry followed by toasted nuts, tobacco and smoked ham. This version has a particularly attractive finale, which is bursting with balsam and menthol freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sophisticated and vibrant with chewy succulence and firm tannins, the top wine of this up and coming Bolgheri estate boasts plush concentration, a nice linear quality and generous aromas of black currant, cedar, licorice, green herb and toasted nuts.

The mouthfeel is tonic and bright and the wine never seems heavy or overdone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A really nice, dark, modern style of Rioja from a good vintage. The nose is mildly foresty early on and robustly fruity, with stand-out black cherry and blackberry aromas. The palate is full, clean and balanced, with alert flavors of berry, spice, citrus peel and chocolate. Smooth as a glass table on the finish. Drink now through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous wine on many fronts. Firstly, its aromas of wild berry, smoke and cedar are focused and pristine. Secondly, the texture it imparts in the mouth is dense, firm but ultimately yielding and plush. Lastly, the wine's fresh flavors endure for many minutes.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Full, heavy, chunky wine with a powerful bouquet of black fruit and chocolate. The palate is about as full and concentrated as they come, but there's good balance and aging potential along with cassis, blackberry and mild herbal shadings. Savory and strong as it is long on the finish. Drinkable now but better from 2011\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense and chewy, this highly nuanced example offers up an enticing combination of animal notes (sweaty saddle, leather) and vibrant fruit (raspberry, cherry). The abundant tannins and ambitious level of oak will benefit from five to 10 years aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bracing and tightly wound, this opens with subdued aromas of pressed rose, resin and a whiff of exotic spice. The evolved palate isn't in sync with the nose, offering raisin and a touch of anise as well as aggressive, astringent tannins that give it an abrupt, raspy finish. It's already drying out so drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Given four years in 100% new French oak and another year in bottle, this is a blockbuster of a wine. It's huge in every way, from its intensity of coconut, vanilla and milk chocolate to its dense, chalky tannins. It may need time to come around, its sheer weight impressively wrapped in blackberry and blueberry jam.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made in the popular modern style, this is a particular success. It shows ultraconcentrated orange, apricot, green apple and peach flavors that are wrapped into a creamy texture, and a strong coating of oak brings layers of butterscotch, buttered toast and vanilla. This richness would be excessive without the minerality and acidity that Sonoma Mountain brings. Don't drink this too cold.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With advice from consultant and Bordeaux University professor Denis Dubourdieu, Batailley has improved immensely in the past few years. This 2010 reinforces that trend, revealing a wine that is structured with Cabernet Sauvignon and is attractive with black currant fruitiness. Age for the medium-term.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, woodshop, raisin and exotic spice carry over to the robust concentrated palate along with fig, prune and a hint of vanilla. The heat of evident alcohol throws it off balance while close-grained tannins give it an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard is in the Oak Knoll District. The wine is dry and full-bodied, packed with ripe blackberries, black cherries and black currants, as well as toasty oak. A bit brusque in tannins at this young age, it should be cellared for a few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The R\\u00c3\\u00b9beo red blend from Verona opens with sweet and jammy aromas of raspberry, strawberry and blueberry jam. There's spice, smoke and cola in the background and the wine is soft and smooth on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Amarone has ripe blackberry aromas, with hints of raisin and spice. The palate shows black cherry, black pepper and prune notes. It has tight tannins and fresh acidity, but needs time to unwind and develop; drink after 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a straightforward Amarone, with dense black fruit and spice aromas. The palate delivers blackberry, plum and raisin flavors, with white pepper and chocolate accents. It doesn't have a lot of complexity, but is delicious and ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The trick to a successful Zinfandel is to capture the grape's briary, brambly rusticity and lend it elegance and balance. This wine succeeds at that task. It's kind of a field blend with 25% of the wine made from what the winemaker calls \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cmixed blacks.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Whatever the varieties are, the wine is smooth, rich and delicious, showing complex wild berry, mocha, licorice, baking spice and sandalwood flavors.

Cellar this wine 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Like most of the Brunellos from this estate, Signature opens with dark, inky concentration and vibrant tones of dark cherry, blackberry preserves, red rose, leather and spice. There's a touch of ripeness to the fruit and the wine shows a spot of sweet fruits on the close. But the fresh acidity and tight structure holds the wine high.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brawny tones of oak spice, milled pepper, eucalyptus, hummus and Bengay are followed by a delicate touch of menthol freshness. Balsam notes of dried rosemary and ginger are divine. Give this wine a few minutes in your glass and a few years in the cellar to evolve even further.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black cherry and berry flavors fill the balanced mouth of this riserva.

The acidity is perfectly balanced and the wine feels soft and lush on the palate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Poggio di Sotto has steadily worked over the years to produce extremely elegant and polished expressions of Brunello that show the best of the local territory. Candied fruit, smoke, light shadings of licorice and tobacco, crushed mineral and white pepper appear on the bouquet. But there's just enough fresh cherry fruit to make your mouth pucker.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There's a freshness to the mouthfeel of this wine that suggests it has many years to go in order to continue its cellaring evolution. Bright cherry aromas are followed by tones of wet earth, red rose, leather and tobacco.

This is a serious wine, intended for food.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Right on the heels of the excellent 2008, this estate-grown Bordeaux-style blend is equally compelling. Bright and tasty fruit flavors of blueberry and black cherry introduce a lively, polished wine with a firm, complex and layered structure. Seventeen months in French oak, roughly half new, has wrapped the fruit in a nicely-layered, textural finish with highlights of mineral, licorice, black olive and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a lot of complex, youthful charm in this Cabernet-based wine, which was grown in both of St. Supery's estate vineyards, Rutherford and Dollarhide. It's very rich and ripe in blackberries, cassis, blueberries and dark chocolate, with a savory spiciness. This really defines the Napa style, and demonstrates the great success of the 2007 vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light and delicate, this wine also offers a lushness to the texture, finding a balance between the two spectrums. Cranberry and strawberry dot a landscape of earthy tobacco and cola-laced oak, finishing with a bold taste of dark chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle aromas vie for a place amidst bold swathes of toasted oak and leather in this concentrated, full-bodied wine. Plum and forest floor fill out the midpalate, striking a balance between ripe fruit and savory seasonings.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dense and woody, this blends 58% Cabernet Sauvignon with 18% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Richly layered, it's tannic and robust in oak, allowing a delicate rendering of cassis and red currant to show quietly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grippy with tannin and firm structure, this warm-vintage wine shows rich red cherry, currant and spicy clove flavors. Tinged with a touch of reduction, it gains depth and mouthfeel from its prominent oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very dry and fairly tannic, it's severe on first sip and hard to appreciate, although there are some good black cherry, cola, leather, oak and black pepper flavors. It's complex in its own way, and gets better as it breathes in the glass. Give it a good, long decanting, and drink it now through 2018. The blend is Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, Grenache, Syrah and Counoise, in that order.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: 89\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009391. Barrel sample.

The palate is fine and juicy, and finishes softly at the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing a good structure of tannins and acids and ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, chocolate and cola, this Cab finishes too sweet. It has a sugary taste, like a health food power bar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around. Give it three or four years for the black currants to marry with the cedar and become smoky-sweet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very good Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend from Agustin Huneeus. While it would not be true to say it's a second wine of Quintessa, it does show the balance and integrity of that bottling, with a firm structure and dramatically layered black currant, mineral and cedar flavors. Will undoubtedly age. Best now through 2011, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with earthy forest floor, leather and oak-derived vanilla notes. The brawny, monolithic palate doles out ripe Morello cherry, raspberry jam and licorice flavors, with a warming layer of alcohol. Solid tannins keep it feeling firm.

The firm palate delivers blackberry, and licorice flavors and a toasted note, set against assertive tannins. Enjoy through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This edition of Barolo Borzoni shows jammy aromas of cherry preserves and raspberry. You'll also detect a note of greenness that comes across as dried sage or olive. The mouthfeel is astringent and tight.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leafy underbrush, espresso, baked plum, menthol and toast aromas slowly emerge. The straightforward palate offers ripe Morello cherry, star anise and chopped herb while assertive tannins clench the abrupt finish. Give the tannins some time to unfurl then drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Something of the structure of Morey is here in this wine. However it is surprisingly ready to drink, with the tannins in the background leaving the foreground to juicy red-berry fruits and fresh acidity. It is attractive and balanced; drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Roasted coffee bean, baked plum, charred earth, toast, vanilla and menthol aromas come together on this. The palate is firm but rather evolved, offering dried, dark-skinned berry, mocha, anise and a confectionary note wrapped in assertive close-grained tannins that dry out the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy game, truffle, underbrush, used leather and dark-skinned fruit aromas lead the nose. They carry over to the taut, tightly wound palate, where austere, dusty tannins leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Concentrated blackberry, currant and vanilla flavors ride a boldly ripe, full-bodied palate that reflects the warmth and intensity of the vintage. Dusty tannin and softened oak allow the fruit to speak, accented by black licorice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark-skinned berry, forest floor and coconut touches lead the nose.

Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose unfolds shyly, revealing black-skinned fruit and baking spice aromas. The palate evokes mature flavors like dried blackberry, tobacco and toast, held together by close-grained tannins. It's rather evolved so drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A heavy and dark version of the variety, this bottling delivers tension and bite from its intense oak. Ripe black cherry and darker blackberry and plum mark the fruit components, laced in a leathery taste of tobacco and tomato leaf.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a liquorous wine, still with its youthful yellow-fruit and honey flavors that are cut with the dry botrytis core. The wine is rich and with a fine balance between the opulence and acidity. This is a wine to savor now, although it will also age further, certainly until 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Candied blackberry aromas meld with tar, rosemary and fennel in this balanced and expertly ripe wine from one of the pioneering families in Temecula. It's dense on the palate, with charred black fruit, dried herb and wild desert-shrub flavors, its alcohol content deftly tucked away.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Superextracted in jammy fruit, this Bordeaux blend has flavors of cherries, blackberries, licorice, mocha and peppery spices. It's very rich, and probably at its best now and for a couple of years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full-bodied and expressively juicy, this is an enjoyable wine right now, rich, earthy and balanced between its notions of red cherry and blackberry fruit and exotic cardamom spice. Harmonious and layered, it finishes with aplomb.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truly a Bordeaux-style blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec from Seven Hills (51%), Pepper Bridge (32%) and Octave vineyards, this wine offers aromas of wood, dark raspberry and licorice. The supple, reserved fruit flavors bring plenty of appeal. Give it time for the oak to fully integrate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Parafada offers a bouquet of prickly fruit such as wild berry, bramble and underbrush. You'll also recognize pretty tones of white truffle, moist earth, new leather and coffee. The wine is bright but still raw in the mouth and ends with mineral notes, a blast of menthol and an interesting powdery texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage of Damilano's Cannubi cru Barolo is very impressive. Chocolate fudge and hazelnut are lavished over very good integrity of fruit. You can make out aromas of red currant, spice and blueberry. The tannins are thick and chewy but will unwind with five to 10 more years in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a soft and supple Barbaresco from winemaker Renato Vacca that ups the ante in terms of intensity, texture and pulpy density. The aromas are ripe and fruit-forward, focusing mainly on soft cherry and creamy vanilla. Yet, the wine's tight tannins and bitter cranberry aftertaste reminds you that this is a true Barbaresco. Drink after 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Camp Gros Martinenga is located on the lower part of Rabaj\\u00c3\\u00a0 at the heart of Barbaresco and produces wines with excellent expansion and staying power.

It is streamlined and firm in the mouth with bright highlights of red currants, pressed violets and dried spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tiny production wine with class and style. It's toasty and dark, with bold black cherry and cassis aromas offset by ample minerality. From the town of Torroja, this 233-case wine is full of molasses, black cherry and other rich, brandied flavors. And it finishes warm, with caramel, coffee and other major-league attributes. Hold until 2010, if possible.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Bric Turot expression delivers sweet aromas of mature berry fruit, spice, mocha, nutmeg and cedar. The generous mouthfeel is round and plush with velvety impressions of melted chocolate and creamy vanilla.

Poderi Marcarini has a long association with this vineyard and has carefully harnessed the natural aromatic intensity of the fruit grown here. Blackberry, cassis and raspberry are enhanced by spice and vanilla. It's a tight, firm wine. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Figuero's top wine is more than fine. The nose begins with meaty, leathery notes and backs them up with spice and ripe fruit. The palate is not flabby or fat; instead it's racy and features good acidity that pushes raspberry, tea, tobacco and nutmeg flavors. A more agile wine than many from this famed region. Should age well for five to ten years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a sharply focused expression of the Bussia cru with a steady delivery of wild berry, underbrush, sour cherry, white mineral, anise and ginger. The aromatic intensity is understated but refined and the wine performs with the same elegance in the mouth. Age this wine for another five to eight years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This vineyard designate Barbaresco delivers elegant mineral tones and pretty accents of chopped herbs, black fruit, forest floor, bramble and licorice. \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cElegance\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is the key word here and the wine finishes with soft tannins and impressive staying power.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe, fleshy black-fruit aromas suggest prune and raisin, while the palate is jammy and full, albeit one notch below precise and exact. Baked, oaky, charred flavors of meaty plum and blackberry finish with toasty overtones and modest heat. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bill Price's ongoing partnership with winemaker Gavin Chanin continues full steam with this deceptively light, mineral-laden wine that nonetheless exudes the power of Durell.

Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe berry, tilled soil, new leather, iris and balsamic aromas merge with chopped herb on this vibrant full-bodied red.

Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a small Chardonnay enclave in the predominantly red premier cru of Beaune Gr\\u00c3\\u00a8ves.

Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black plum, candied blueberry, garden herb and anise aromas show on the nose of this luscious bottling from Matt Villard and Rick Hudson.

Fennel, smoked meat and vanilla notes play a supporting role.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine from a densely planted southeast-facing vineyard is still firmly structured with a dry core of tannins.

A touch of violet comes to the fore on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Could use greater acidity and structure to provide a framework for all the fruit, but that fruit sure is attractive.

Red fruit and a light grip of oak wrap around a softly textured body, making for an approachable, easygoing experience.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very dense, very rich, and really too thick in primary fruit flavors to enjoy now. Almost like a blackberry, cassis and chocolate-filled pastry, with the oaky overlay playing the role of sweet, smoky crust, and the alcohol providing heat. Soft, too. Not particularly elegant now, but might age, if you want to roll the dice on this pricey 100% Cab.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heavily oaked, with peanut aromas masking the fruit. But in the mouth it has more accessible fruit\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094mostly cassis\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and once again the full allotment of wood.

Will the fruit emerge?\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Impressive and elegant, this one leans American with its R & B name and packaging, but is rather French in profile. The black-cherry fruit is offset by a lead-pencil element reminiscent of some top Bordeaux chateaus. Angular and fairly crisp, it shows coffee accents and a fairly long finish. If it adds some weight with age, it will drink above the present rating.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leathery fruit and a bit of bramble or field greens mark the nose, and the earthy red-currant palate strikes a claret-like note.

Drink sooner than later, and try to serve it with food.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made by Cathy Corison, this wine is now in its second vintage, where it shows black-cherry fruit touched up by leather and spice. A big wine needing some time to come together; it is stylish for sure, with a vivid, exciting finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plum aromas are pounded home with notes of meat and menthol. When you next hear the word \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009copaque,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d think of this. But the body is surprisingly svelte, and the flavors emphasize red fruit. Some tannins are manifested on the finish, which shows licorice and buttery oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Meaty and also jammy, with popcorn and cedar aromas. Dry and complex, typical of the winery's style, and mildly astringent. The tannins are starching at this point, but should fade. Given time, the red fruit should emerge and conquer the youthful astringency.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Extremely dark, with toast, cherry liqueur and forest notes on the nose; this opens into deep black fruit, licorice and espresso flavors. The mouthfeel is full and rich, as it transitions effortlessly into a smooth, dry, anise and briar-tinged finish that has an interesting and elegant viscosity to it. A black beauty needing three to five years to develop.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of inky, jammy aromas of black fruit set up the red-fruit palate that is covered with a blanket of powerful oak.

Elegance is not its strong suit right now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bouquet of dark red fruits and heavy cedar accents opens this even, well-balanced offering.

But the 2010 simply is not in the same league of past bottlings. It's pleasant with rich blackberry, cherry, cocoa and new oak flavors, all wrapped up with fine tannins.

An elegant bruiser, it needs three to four years to come around.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep and sweet, but there's also an unusual and appetizing edge offered via cola nut and root beer.

A layer of well-smoked oak overlays everything. This is a flamboyant wine and will reward careful cellaring.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A blend of Sangiovese and Merlot in equal parts, this concentrated wine opens with aromas of vanilla, ripe black-skinned fruit and mocha. The supple palate offers coconut, toast and black plum alongside velvety tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of blueberry, cedar and a whiff of rosemary. The juicy polished palate offers red currant, raspberry and Mediterranean herb. It closes on a vanilla note. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tannic waves of tartness add to a complicated, slightly carbonic edginess in this wine, accentuated by ripe black fruit that almost seems baked. Spicy acidity and a hit of forest floor make it savory and substantially rewarding.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a purely varietal, estate-grown wine from Mount George, cave-aged for nearly two years in all-new French oak. Generously expansive on the palate, it offers full-bodied richness around a thoughtful layering of clove, juicy black cherry and savory red currant, lingering on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 80% Sangiovese, 10% Syrah and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of forest floor, scorched earth, roasted coffee bean and dark spice. The firm dense palate offers blackberry jam, dried cherry, licorice and espresso alongside substantial close-grained tannins that give the finish grip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the St. Peter of Alcantara Vineyard in the Templeton Gap area, this blend of 62% Petite Sirah, 19% Grenache, 13% Syrah and 6% Zinfandel shows blueberry, boysenberry, slate minerality, uncracked peppercorns and a wild mint/woody shrub character on the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry and blueberry, tobacco, black loam, dried herbs and pencil lead.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's dry, with just-in-time acidity brightening pleasant raspberry, red currant and sandalwood flavors. As it warms in the glass, certain instabilities emerge. It's not an ager.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This lovely wine, a Monopole, is already showing complex, forward fruit with flavors of plum, cherry and cranberry. Soft and fulsome, it shows a light hand with the oak, allowing nuances of tobacco and leather to emerge. Good weight and texture, it seems bound for early glory.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rion holds back on the new oak, letting the pure, supple fruit speak for itself. This is a muscular Vosne, young and firm, showing excellent focus and structure. Already the finish lingers beautifully, with layers of texture and tightly wrapped fruit. Should cellar well for a decade or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another premier cru from Michel Gros, this one not as elegant and fruity as the R\\u00c3\\u00a9as. Instead it goes for more ripeness, more tannic weight, and a lot more roasted scents from the barrels. Big, rawboned but undeniably appealing, it has a lot of rough-hewn flavor, dominated by toast, tannin and tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a lovely, fragrant Burgundy, with a smoky/cherry scented nose leading into a rather tight, hard young wine. Hints of rosewater, graham cracker and tobacco are there, along with some green tannins. Medium body and texture; needs more time to show its best stuff.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is dominated by the attractive scents of new French oak, with some hints of pipe tobacco and just a whiff of volatile acidity. It is tight and tannic, a bit \\\"lifted\\\" with the VA, and at this point not showing much fruit or complexity, given the price.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An impressive wine that presents a full bouquet with bready, leesy, toasty aromas, and intriguing lemon and caramel hints. The palate sports attractive fruit and spice flavors that are both complex and lovely, if a challenge to define. There\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a long full finish to this top-notch American sparkler.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Rioja Baja Garnacha is earthy on the nose, with aromas of stewed berry fruits, tomato and raisin. The palate is livelier than the aromas, but this still feels a bit heavy and stewed. Flavors of vanilla, root beer and saucy berry fruits lack pop on a finish that seems to be tiring.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Hugely dense, foursquare wine with great fruit and the purest tannins. Chocolate and coffee predominate at the same time as sweet tannins and acidity. A wine that combines charm with great power.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: One of the peculiarities of St.-\\u00c3\\u0089milion's classification is that Canon la Gaffeli\\u00c3\\u00a8re is not classed in the top rung. Because, as this wine shows, it produces superb wines. This is ripe while so elegant, with great intensity and sweet perfumes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tremendous Chardonnay. As always, the winery's '09 is bone dry, crisply acidic and minerally. You might call it austere at this point, with its tart finish of grapefruit. But a great Hanzell Chardonnay will improve for at least a decade, possible two, and this is a great Hanzell Chardonnay. The score reflects what the wine likely will be approximately eight years down the road.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and ripe enough to drink now, after a decent decanting, it shows pure raspberry, blueberry and cherry fruit flavors, subtlely accented with cola and baking spices, and all of it wrapped into thick but smooth tannins. Good as it is, it will gain traction over the next 15 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rutherford Hill has specialized in Merlot for decades, and their Reserve bottling is always one of the best. This 2007 is right up there, rich, dense and opulent. It shows massive blackberry, cherry, blueberry, anise and cedar flavors, wrapped into a fine tannin-acid structure, and the finish is dry. Perfect with the best steak you can find.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fabulous blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot delivers loads of plush softness and succulent richness. Aromas of chocolate, ripe fruit and spice are distinct and clear, and the wine shows compelling complexity and intensity overall.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A rich and opulent wine, very ripe, packed with luscious blackberry and damson fruit as well as sweet tannins. It is a fruit salad of fruit flavors given structure by a core of dryness. Already a gorgeous wine, but one that will also age.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Elegant as well as rich, this is a beautiful wine. It has great depth of flavor, the sweetest fruit, deliciously ripe. At the same time, the tannins are an underlying sustenance to the impressive ageworthiness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A gorgeously perfumed wine, dominated by the ripest Cabernet Franc, combining richness and an intense structure. With its tannins, it will age well over many years. The fruit is finely textured, deliciously juicy, showing the most complex series of flavors.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Paleo is a landmark Italian expression of Cabernet Franc that is not at all bashful in terms of fullness and richness. Bold fruit and black cherry aromas have been soften by careful oak tones of spice and leather. Structured, firm but also velvety in texture, this wine needs more years to evolve.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This represents a debut vintage from a brand new estate in a little-known corner of southern Tuscany made with consultant Michel Rolland. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot and the results are savory and delicious, with lingering tones of blackberry, rum cake, spice and leather.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With its superripe, jammy fruit, this is lush and opulent. It does have a fine structure as well as bitter chocolate and dark tannins. A hugely powerful wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark and structured, this is a firm wine. It has a smoky wood character, powerful tannins over intensely ripe fruit. Acidity and sweetness balance to give a dense wine, powered with richness and destined to age for many years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Impressively weighty wine, with a fine combination of tannins, full fruit and a solid, chunky core. The wine is rich, but it also has a sweet acidity. Powerful ageworthy wine, never losing sight of elegance.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Mint aromas hint at the wood, but more important is the massive Merlot fruit that is an essential element in the blend. The result is a wine that blends richness and power with an initially severe character. Slowly it opens to reveal opulent blackberry jam flavors, immensely ripe.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet is a blend of estate and purchased fruit. In a successful year, it rivals Stag's Leap's best wines, including Cask 23, and 2008 was a very successful year. Blended with 2% Merlot, and aged in lots of new French oak, the wine is, in a word, stunning. Rich, flashy blackberry and dark chocolate flavors are anchored by an earthiness suggesting cured olives and dried herbs. Delicious now, this beauty should develop additional complexities throughout the decade.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A seductive wine, deliciously ripe with the softest, juiciest fruit over smoky new wood. The wine shows intense fruit as well as a soft Merlot core. The tannins are beautifully integrated in this ripely sweet wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Straight down the line, this wine shows fruit and acidity. The tannins are relatively soft while the fruit is forward. Blackberries, coffee and licorice notes all come together.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tart elderberry, purple flowers, anise, bay leaf and other chaparral aromas show on the nose of this blend of 20% Carmen\\u00c3\\u00a8re, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Cabernet Franc, 20% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot. Forest-driven flavors power the palate, where firm but forgiving tannins present black cherry and dark chocolate shavings.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is tight and closed up. It does suggest plenty of fruit weight, hinting at toast and apple flavors that will come through over the next several years to give a rich wine. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Black-skinned fruit, iris, espresso, dark spice and a balsamic note all meld together in the glass along with a whiff of chopped herb. The firmly structured palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry jam, toast, roasted coffee bean and a hint of oak-driven spice alongside fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush wild berry, iris grilled herb, vineyard dust and a balsamic note take center stage. The polished palate offers morello cherry, raspberry compote, baking spice and anise alongside refined tannins and fresh acidity. It's already tempting and nicely balanced but hold for more complexity. Drink 2021\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: New leather, woodland berry, dark spice and menthol aromas unfold in the glass. It's bright and juicy, offering tight layers of raspberry compote, morello cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside firm, chewy tannins. Fresh acidity lends balance while a graphite note energizes the finish. Give this time to unwind and develop even more complexity. Drink 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932038.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the producer's 1,400-foot-high estate vineyard atop the Petaluma Gap, this wine is richly layered in boysenberry, baked cherry and pine. Moderately structured, it has an underlying minerality of stony earth to keep it fresh and balanced despite its robust power and concentration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Attractive aromas of rose, wild berry and aromatic herb lead the nose on this elegantly structured red. The bright palate offers crushed raspberry, juicy dark cherry, licorice and clove alongside firm polished tannins. A flinty mineral note energizes the finish. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas suggesting underbrush, wild berry, tobacco and a whiff of aromatic herb on this. The palate isn't quite as expressive as the nose and is still tightly wound, offering red cherry, cranberry and white pepper alongside a backbone of tense tannins and bright acidity. Give it time to unfold. Drink 2025\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, leather and aromatic herb aromas slowly appear in the glass along with a subtle whiff of violet. The taut palate is still tightly wound, offering red cherry, cranberry and star anise alongside youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine shows mint aromas and big black-fruit flavors. With high toast wood aging, it feels extracted, with bitter chocolate paralleling the blackberry fruits. It has considerable power and density and needs aging. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Richness is the operative word with this 100% Cabernet. That's due to the exceptional ripeness, reflected in opulent blackberry, cherry and milk chocolate flavors, as well as in the high alcohol, which gives it a heady, porty heat. Not an ager, but an opulent Napa Cab to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This robust Amarone has an earthy fragrance of underbrush, mushroom and tobacco leaf along with plum and spice notes. The dense, delicious palate offers rich black cherry, ripe raspberry, cinnamon and vanilla. It's concentrated, with a velvety texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Petit Verdot is a hard variety to successfully make on its own. Although this has intense flavors of blackberries, black currants and dark chocolate, there's not much beyond the seemingly sweet flavors. The high alcohol lends this a Port-like heat.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This has strong acidity giving a sour candy taste to the raspberry and cherry flavors. The oak overlay is just fine, the texture is silky, and the finish is dry, but that acidity will likely never go away.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark, big, bold and extracted, this Syrah has tough tannins that are threaded with intricate flavors of blackberry, licorice, pepper, cola and grilled bacon. The astringency will stand up to big, rich roasted and grilled meats, but it doesn't seem likely to make gains beyond the next 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Baked plum and stewed black cherry show on the nose of this precise blend of 35.6% Malbec, 28.75% Petit Verdot, 23.75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 11.9% Cabernet Franc, with burned caramel, licorice and cherry cordial as well. The palate is rich with a decent tannic structure, showing a ripe blueberry-blackberry-chocolate-syrup flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing the heat of the vintage, this opens with aromas of charred earth, stewed prune, blackberry compote and grilled herb. The big, chewy palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry compote and nutmeg accompanied by velvety tannins. You'll also detect the heat of evident alcohol on the mid-palate. Give it another few years then drink sooner rather later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Syrah-dominated, estate-grown red is loaded with the savory highlights for which the Rocks region is noted. A small addition of Cabernet Sauvignon adds muscle to the tannins, while a splash of Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre contributes a bit of earth and stone. Tightly wound raspberry fruit anchors a compact and tangy core. This is a beautifully balanced wine that should cellar well through 2024 or longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From high atop the hills above Freestone, this Pinot Noir saw 10% stem inclusion during fermentation and was aged in 20% new oak for just over a year to achieve enviable structure and bite amid an intensity of raspberry and strawberry kirsch flavor. This gorgeous wine will open up even more if held in bottle until 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019. But it's so good now you'll find it hard to wait.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Boysenberry and blueberry form the fruit aromas on this wine made by the family of former Los Angeles Laker Sasha Vujacic. In addition, it features a dark black-dirt minerality, black olive, cinnamon bark and absinthe-like scents. The tannins coat the mouth along with blue and purple fruit flavors, and it ends with strong acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe, loamy aromas of black fruits are accented by notes of sandalwood, graphite and exotic spices. This is chunky and a bit jammy in feel. Flavors of smoky oak, berry fruits and chocolate finish with baking-spice flavors that are woven into black-fruit tastes. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Frederick bottling is 55% Cabernet Sauvignon and 31% Merlot, with other Bordeaux grapes filling in the rest. Chewy and tannic, it seems to have a green edge to its fruit and tannins. Nonetheless, there are plenty of flavors of berry, spice and black pepper, with highlights of coffee and cacao. This has lots to chew on, plus good length.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the bigger Syrahs out there, generously proportioned and calling out for equally rich fare. Try beef short ribs or coq au vin, using the same wine for the dish. It's tannic and enormous, with flavors of ripe black cherry and teriyaki sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From estate-grown Merlot (78%), Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine is shy on the nose and full bodied in flavor, offering ripe, fleshy blackberry, tar and espresso.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This appealing Rioja hits with prune and raisin aromas. On the palate, bulky, grabby tannins are rugged and provide structure to an otherwise very ripe wine. Flavors of coconut, mocha, plum and black currant give this a Mounds bar character. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied, voluptuous wine is spicy in red fruit and floral aromas that lend it a finessed, elegant air. Soft and round, with structure and acidity, it ends in bittersweet chocolate and clove. Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, violet, leather and crushed culinary herb aromas unfold in this ripe and rounded wine. The palate offers juicy red cherry, star anise and ground sage flavors alongside solid, seasoned tannins. It's already surprisingly accessible. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Waxy plum is given ample richness from a taste of milk chocolate in this luxuriously full-bodied voluptuous wine. Big lush tannins are met by a smoky backdrop of robust oak and a spicy hit of clove on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fans of full-bodied reds should like this Cabernet/Merlot blend for its pure berry and mint aromas, its ruby luster, and dry, clean raspberry and chocolate flavors. There are full tannins now, indicating that it will age well for about five years, maybe more. And it finishes nicely.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle and soft, this aromatic Bordeaux blend (54% Cab Sauvignon, 9% Carmen\\u00c3\\u00a8re, 9% Merlot, 10% Malbec, 18% Petit Verdot) is laced with herb and exotic and savory spices, woven through tight fruit flavors of blueberry and musky grape. This is a delicate, evocative and challenging wine that rewards your attention. Fascinating and complex, it needs time to breathe and good glassware to really open up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard-select is denser and richer than the estate's base Vino Nobile. The extraction and thickness is more noticeable here and the wine tastes chewy and juicy in the mouth with flavors that recall ripe cherry, wet earth and exotic spice. It is aged in barrique for 18 months.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of stewed plum, cherry marinated in spirits, cellar floor and a hint of soy sauce. The aromas carry over to the dense palate along with licorice and a hint of orange peel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Menthol, ripe berry, vanilla and mocha aromas emerge in the glass. The palate offers dried black cherry, coffee and toast but not much fruit richness alongside bracing tannins that leave an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deceptively shy about its use of oak, this white exudes rich aromas of baked pear and vanilla yet delivers a refreshing amount of acidity on the palate, remaining crisp yet softly layered around a medium build. The finish lingers on a ginger snap accent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wealth of maraschino cherry pops in taste and aroma in this wine, followed by dense black cherry and cinnamon. Supple and light-to-medium bodied, it's a balanced expression of the variety, with complexity and character.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cheesy oak and raw cherry and plum aromas create a nose that needs time in the glass to show its best. This Rioja feels fresh and tight, with pulling tannins. Zesty plum and cherry flavors carry a peppery side note prior to a snappy finish with similar flavors.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This ripe and fruity wine has just the right amount of mineral texture to give it a zesty character. It offers hints of toast, attractive juicy acidity and a lively, bright aftertaste. The wine needs to lose the slight earthy flavor from bottling that should soon blow away.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a strong foundation of oak, this well-made wine broods in grippy tannin and black cherry fruit, imparting muscular highlights of leather and tobacco. As it finds its way to a seamless lengthy finish, accents of chocolate-covered espresso beans play on.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with subtle aromas suggesting underbrush, exotic spice, vanilla, menthol and toast. On the structured palate, bright acidity and firm, fine-grained tannins support ripe Marasca cherry, clove and star anise flavors. Drink 2021\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932031.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a pungent or slightly volatile note of fresh cedar or red apple that dominates this wine and leaves little room for the wine's natural complexity to show. This Barolo is also less active in the mouth and tastes older than it really is.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Old wines are not easy to appreciate, so we'd almost rather have you judge this wine. In our opinion, it's way too sour and lacking in fruit to justify rave reviews. Thirty years of age doesn't seem to have helped it, and what's left is sherried and pruny, yet with sharp acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Olmaia is a pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon that hits all the right marks. You can taste the variety's natural flavors but they never seem green or medicinal. Instead the wine is plush, soft, round and opulent, with ideal harmony and balance and beautiful delivery of chocolate, cherry, vanilla and herbal aromas. The wine almost exaggerates, if possible, its generosity and roundness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an expertly extracted and penetrating Sangiovese-based wine (with a small percentage of other grapes mixed in) that boasts an absolutely irresistible nose. It is generous and full, sweet and succulent and will definitely please now or in 10 years. Black cherries and chocolate are the main themes, with coffee and chewy tannins in the mouth: An exciting discovery from a relatively unknown estate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet Franc is dedicated to the late brother of Marilisa Allegrini (co-owner of the 110-acre estate). This is a top-notch wine, with succulence, intensity and outstanding wood integration. The spice, chocolate, campfire and leather notes blend seamlessly. In the mouth, the wine is vibrant and long-lasting, with chocolate notes on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is at the top of its class in a new generation of super Tuscan producers. Plush and velvety, it opens with rich aromas of chocolate, cherry, peppercorn, black fruit and cola. Thick extraction sets the tone for a lush wine that requires a few more years in the bottle: Drink after 2012.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Saffredi is one of the most exciting super Tuscans of the year. The blend is Cabernet, Merlot and Alicante and the results of underscore the immense potential of Maremma. The wine is vibrant, intense and sprightly with an outstandingly complex offering of pristine aromas: ripe cherry, floral essences, red apple and subdued almond.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Impossibly intense and rich, Giusto di Notri is a compelling blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot that takes brutal hold of your senses thanks to its amazing density and texture. The long list of aromas generated here includes black cherry, spice, tobacco and cola and the wine glides in excruciating slow motion over the palate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an exceptional Syrah with a spirited Tuscan soul that delivers great intensity throughout and spicy tones of ripe fruit, smoked bacon, blueberry syrup and freshly milled black pepper. It's a beautiful expression of the variety with an impeccable mouthfeel and pristine flavors that ride strong until the very end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is made from a curious 70-20-10 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Teroldego (an indigenous grape of northern Italy). The results include black currant, lead pencil, green spice, natural rubber, smoked bacon and lingering blueberry. With its thick, chewy succulence, jackhammer tannins and amazing length, it will hold 20 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: La Ricolma opens with a blast of black olive then builds in intensity to include aromas of juicy fruit, blackberry, molasses, chalky mineral and chocolate fudge. This 100% Merlot is generous and opulent to the very end.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Mostly Cabernet with 305 Sangiovese, Camartina is a thick, solid, streamlined wine that shows the highest level of winemaking expertise. Sweet cherry, bramble, espresso, plum, blackberry peel off layer after layer. The wine boasts chewy tannins and a bold mouthfeel. Drink after 2012.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an expertly crafted Merlot that offers much in terms of intensity, charm and personality. You could drink it with a fork and knife because its concentration is dark, plush and extracted with care. Pristine aromas of flower petal, red fruit, molasses and spice are rounded off by an outstanding mouthfeel consisting of extraordinary length and polished tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The beauty of this wine is in its elegant, restrained character. There are no loose ends or sharp spikes here. Instead, the 85-15 Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot blend is extremely compact and streamlined with beautiful extraction and pretty notes of chocolate, spice, tobacco and bold cherry. Imported by Vias Imports.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from a clonal selection of the estate's best Cabernet Sauvignon, this cheerful red is concentrated and extracted with a seductively sweet-smelling nose. It is by no means simple: Background aromas of tar, root beer, espresso, chopped mint and bright berry speak to its Tuscan roots. It's still a bit thick and chewy in the mouth, so drink it after 2012 and give it time to open.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Inky concentration and pretty sweet cherry come right at you thanks to the natural intensity of this Merlot-Cabernet-Petit Verdot blend. The wine's thick fruitiness  extends deep and wide over the palate, giving it a distinct personality. The tannins are still a bit tight; drink after 2010.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Arnione, a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Petit Verdot, packs heat and intensity and is a beautifully integrated and generous wine. Thick extraction is accented by chocolate, cherry, leather, cigar, liquid vanilla and root beer. It's tight in the mouth with bright fruit flavors. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This release of Luca Sanjust's monumental Merlot is more subdued than the previous vintage, but what it lacks in intensity it makes up for in elegance. Instead of bursting red fruit and thick density, this feminine wine offers bite-size bursts of soft cherry, forest floor and toasted almond. It's smooth and supple in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine that gives you everything you could possibly want: complexity, elegance, intensity and a long, creamy finish. Oreno is a 50-25-25 blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese (which prove to be perfect proportions in this case). It exhibits aromas of bright cherry, prune, plum, espresso grinds and cedar wood.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's just something about this 50-50 Sangiovese-Merlot blend that makes it absolutely irresistible. The fullness, the harmony, the intensity of aromas and the long, fruity persistency on the finish work together to produce one of the great modern super Tuscans.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This top-notch blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc from Mazzei's beautiful Maremma property boasts thick, modern concentration and pretty renderings of red fruit, vanilla and exotic spice. It has excellent texture in the mouth and is velvety and lively at the same time.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Suolo is 100% Sangiovese and this is one of the best vintages ever for this delicate, feminine wine. The purity and intensity of its aromas are outstanding and the wine's complexity makes it a pleasure to contemplate over a long meal. There's a distinctive Brunello-like touch to its soul.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage has some Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot in the blend to back the Sangiovese and Merlot, and is more complex and complete. There's cherry, tobacco, leather, spice, black fruit and a touch of cool freshness in the form of leafy greens. It's a sophisticated wine with tight tannins and a long, dusty finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabreo is a bulldozer of a wine with brawny power, solid dimension and hearty aromas of smoked bacon, black ink, tar and chocolate fudge. The blend is 70-30 Sangiovese and Cabernet and the dense concentration achieved with these two grapes is remarkable.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a well-built and elegant Cabernet Sauvignon (with 5% Sangiovese) with thick layers of cherry, forest bramble, caramel, molasses and smoky tobacco-like tones that are deep and penetrating. It scores high in terms of intensity, complexity and ends with fresh, menthol nuances on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With eight years of age on it, this wine is at a beautiful point in its evolution with delicate elegance, refined perfumes and special accents on cinnamon, mineral tones and bright fruit. It's sophisticated and persistent, with silky tannins and sweet spice on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Clearly well-origined, to judge from the fine structure and essential purity. But it's a very tannic, closed wine, with a mouth-numbing astringency that accentuates the acidity. Even so, it's so ripe in blackberries and currants it's almost drinkable now, with a good decant. But you're best off cellaring a good 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blue flower, ripe plum, vanilla, underbrush and leather aromas waft out of the glass. The palate delivers black cherry, coffee, toast, black pepper and clove alongside tightly-knit tannins.

Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's forward and evolved with soft acidity. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of new oak, leafy underbrush, exotic spice and steeped plum that carry through to firm palate along with notes of dried black cherry and coconut. Grippy tannins give it an astringent, teeth-coating finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heavy, rooty aromas of stewed black plum, raisin and prune set up a thick, tannic palate that's jammy like the nose. Prune, raisin and chocolate flavors are oaky and very ripe, thus the finish is earthy, baked in feel and raisiny in flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This ripe, sweet-fruited wine is soft and quite mature. Red fruits have developed into a smooth and round texture with a delicate mushroom character. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Napa-Sonoma winery, straddled across two counties, has added 12% Cabernet Sauvignon to the Cab Franc in this wine. The result is sizable in ripe, blueberry and blackberry fruit, soft tannins and a finish of dark chocolate. Void of any of the variety's signature herbaceous signature, it could easily be mistaken for Cabernet Sauvignon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 70% Sangiovese and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of baked plum, espresso, and baking spice. The robust palate opens with black fruit, chocolate and licorice alongside gripping tannins. You'll also notice the warmth of evident alcohol on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 50% Cabernet Sauvignon and 50% Syrah, this opens with delicate aromas of cassis and sandalwood. The palate delivers dried black cherry, toast, licorice and black pepper alongside gripping tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this offers strawberry and tomato aromas. The round and ready palate provides raspberry, green tea and a touch of vanilla alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas that recall underbrush, toast, oak and ripe black-skinned berry come together on this. The tightly wound palate offers dried red currant, raw cherry, roasted coffee bean and a note of sage while dusty, almost grainy tannins clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard planted on the edge of Freestone by James MacPhail of MacPhail Family Wines and respected grower Jim Pratt, this wine opens with a splash of white pepper that persists on the soft, silky palate. Roses and black tea provide savory flavor, with an intensity of forest floor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A collaboration between Winemakers Elizabeth Vianna (Chimney Rock), Bryan Parker (Terlato Vineyards) and Steve Fennell (Sanford), this is a blend of Sauvignon Blanc from Napa, Chardonnay from Carneros and Viognier from Sta. Rita Hills. Golden in color, it's buttery in style, with subversive fruit that leans lemony crisp and tart on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toast, oak and sage aromas follow through to the lean palate along with espresso, dried cherry and a note reminiscent of buttered popcorn. It's tightly wound, with aggressive tannins that leave a bracing finish. Give the tannins a few years to soften then drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of hay, oak, dill and a whiff of cellar floor that follow over to the lean palate along with coffee grounds and powdered sage. Astringent tannins give it a bracing finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Schisty minerality infiltrates blackberry, cassis and raisin aromas. In the mouth, this is fully saturated and jammy. Flavors of blueberry and raisin suggest borderline overripeness, while the finish is jammy and pinched.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This oak-dominated wine recalls the ubiquitous wood-driven Tuscan offerings from the late 1990s and early 2000s. A blend of Cabernet, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Syrah, it delivers hardcore oak, wood chips, vanilla, chocolate and espresso sensations, with black currant and blackberry lying low in the foreground.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Previous bottlings from this vineyard have been much better. This vintage is intensely ripe, almost Port-like, with cherry pie, cola and red currant flavors, and a hit of sweet oak. The acidity is just fine, but the wine lacks subtlety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While this is a good, sound Cabernet, it is not the winery's finest effort. Dry in style with black currant flavors that are austere, the wine is more notable for its tannins and acidity. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's lots of upfront blackberry, currant and cherry fruit in this Syrah, along with savory, meaty notes of sweet bacon and charred meat. With complex tannins but fairly soft acidity, it's an ambitious, delicious wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Attractive aromas of dark berry, blue flower, sweet baking spice and a whiff of pipe tobacco waft out of the glass. The fresh, tight palate delivers tart cherry, crunchy strawberry, white pepper, clove and chopped herb alongside firm, polished tannins. It still needs to unwind. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich, full-bodied wine with small amounts of Merlot and Malbec, this offers sizable tannins that wrap themselves around dark, brooding fruit and smoky oak. Blackberry and plum intertwine around luxurious chocolate and tobacco, complementing one another on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An exceptional example of an underappreciated appellation, this Gattinara offers up a gorgeous nose of animal, leather and spice accented by high floral tones. The palate has mature tannins and a complex tangle of flavors ranging from charcoal-grilled meat to earth and mushrooms. A nice kick of acidity on the finish means it can stand up to even the heaviest duck dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A highly nuanced nose leaning more toward animal and mineral notes than fruit opens this muscular effort. Leather, ash and forest fire flavors dominate the palate, framed by sinewy tannins. A few cherry notes peek through the tar-infused finish. Serve with game.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cTerre Nobili,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d which is Italian for \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cnoble lands,\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d is a blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot and Refosco. Aged for 24 months in oak, it opens with bright fruit intensity, bearing notes of spice, rosemary and tobacco. The mouthfeel is acidic, making it a good choice to enjoy with cheesy lasagna with b\\u00c3\\u00a9chamel sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Basically characterized by gigantic fruit that leaves little to the imagination. Blackberries, cherries, cola and spicy plums explode in the mouth, and while the wine is technically dry, it's sweet in fruity essence. Oak adds caramel and vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This estate delivered a fine Rosso di Montalcino in 2008 and less certain results with its Brunello the same year. The issue is the sharp acidity that really makes your mouth pucker. Thankfully, the intense crispness is balanced by softer spice, black fruit and tobacco aromas.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe berry, brown cooking spice and a whiff of espresso lead the nose on this full-bodied red. The firmly structured palate offers juicy raspberry, black cherry and licorice alongside a backbone of assertive but noble tannins. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932032.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep and dense aromas of olallieberry and black plum integrate with vanilla bean and lilac on the nose of this bottling by Steve Martell, formerly of Sextant Winery. A soft mouthfeel unleashes well-integrated flavors, with lavender, pepper, baked blackberry and charcoal simmering to the surface through intense acidity. Great now, it will last many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Multifaceted aromas of dark cherry, leather, pressed violet, iron, dark spice and a balsamic note take shape on this intriguing red. Despite its age, the wine still shows freshness, power and finesse, offering mature black cherry, white pepper and star anise alongside velvety tannins. A mineral note lifts the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a newly released wine, sultry and peppery, with lip-smacking waves of blackberry and raspberry, bold and brooding and ultimately delicious. Full-bodied, it finds balance between its velvety texture and spikes of black pepper and leather.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Among the producer's most luxurious offerings, this nearly 100% varietal wine (with 2% Petit Verdot) is grippy in tobacco and big, pillowy tannin. The leaner side of its personality is defined by classic notions of cedar, currant and graphite, while its other aspect reveals riper elements of mountain blackberry and chocolate mocha. They all work well together in sync.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of menthol, flint, crushed herb, leather and a balsamic note come together in the glass. Smooth and vibrant, the elegant palate delivers dried cherry, strawberry, star anise, pipe tobacco and mineral framed in polished tannins and bright acidity. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of 67% Merlot grown in Carneros with 33% Cabernet Franc from Atlas Peak. Tense in bittersweet clove, tea and big, extracted tannins, it settles down midpalate to reveal an underlying crispness of red fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bit too soft, which makes the exceptionally ripe blackberry and chocolate flavors stand alone and lack structure. Tasty and flashy, but the palate longs for more acids and tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smells and tastes just great, with all the hallmarks of an important Napa Cabernet. It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque. It wants 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00937 years of age to begin to strut its stuff. Open after 2012.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A darkly colored, tannic Cabernet whose dry astringency keeps it from being thoroughly enjoyable now. Despite the astringency, however, it showcases an immaculate core of blackberries and black currants. Elegant and classy, it should age well throughout the decade.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rich, packed with  juicy fruit. The wine has weight, depth of fruit flavor and tannins as a central core. A smoky character indicates the wood aging, packing in with the acidity and black cherry fruits on the finish. Age for 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Hews to the Hanzell style, which is almost old-fashioned in this age of ripely opulent Pinot Noirs. This one's tight as a drum in tannins and acids, a quivery, nervously wound wine. Yet it's quite rich and complex, with a tapestry of cherry, red licorice, tobacco, Canadian bacon, dusty Indian spice and buttered toast flavors.  Needs 7\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years in the cellar, and, based on tastings of very old Hanzell, should slowly unfold through the 2020s.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: If, at first sip, this seems delicate, that's an illusion. Reticent would be a better word, for this is a wine that is still youthful, with the toast and crisp acidity acting as a framework to the rich green and white fruits that are developing. Keep for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Really ripe wine, with toast and yellow fruits, laced with intense citric acidity and a mineral edge, to go with the mouthwatering fruit. Needs to age for 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A great Hanzell Chardonnay, which means you don't want to drink it now. Dry and acidic, it's an aloof young wine whose minerality gives it a tough tang of steel despite a heart of citrus fruit. Give it 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years in a good cellar, and it will develop interestingly beyond that.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a classic Napa Valley floor Cabernet, enhanced with handfuls of Petit Verdot and Merlot. Dusty in red currant and herb, it offers mellowed tannins and a peppery underbelly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tough in tannins and dustily dry, this is a hard wine to warm up to. It's not just the astringency but the absence of fruit. Shows modest flavors of cherries and blackberries, and doesn't seem like an ager. A disappointment.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This feels sharp and raw, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, plus a streak of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The tannins and raisin flavor stick out on this bone-dry, rustic Bordeaux-style blend. It offers rich notes of blackberry tart, dark chocolate and roasted almonds. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, crushed herb and blue flower. The palate is tightly wound and rather closed, showing hints of orange zest and raw cranberry. Racy acidity and austere tannins clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an evolved and sophisticated Vino Nobile with rich concentration, dense texture and very pretty, wood-driven notes of vanilla and spice that are splashed evenly over black currants, plums and prunes. The wine exhibits harmony and balance, and although it is on the thick or gritty side, it does have the natural tannins to pair with succulent meat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Structure defines this wine. It has a great architecture of tannins, acids and oak, with a firm, dry finish. That stands it in stark relief to today's modern cult style of fruity softness, and to the wine's credit. It's Bordeaux-like, with cherry, currant, herb and cedar flavors, and should develop over the next decade. A winery to watch.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While this wine is not powerful, it has elegance to go with the ripe fruit, fresh honey, lemon flavors and a core of dense dryness. With this vintage, Rayne Vigneau seems to be back where its vineyard, next to Yquem, suggests it should be.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This comes from Bacio Divino, which has been crafting wines under that label for some years. The consulting winemaker was the veteran Nils Venge. The wine is dry, full-bodied and very ripe, showing classic Napa cassis flavors wrapped into superfine tannins. As good as it is, one wonders what sets it apart from all the rest.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Call this traditional, a throwback, or whatever you want, because it's a less-polished wine with a strong sense of buttery oak and animal. It's also challenging and strained, with herbal tart plum flavors and a strong note of cheesy oak to the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Oak, coconut, espresso and menthol aromas lift out of the glass. The taut somewhat lean palate shows raw sour cherry, tart cranberry, espresso and oak-driven spice but not much fruit richness. Tight raspy tannins dry out the finish. Let the tannins soften for a few years then drink to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Initial charred aromas turn to licorice and black fruit on the nose. A rigid structure of fierce tannins provide strength to toasty, spicy berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, herb and mocha tones combine with textural dryness on the finish. Drink though 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A special spot for Syrah, Parmalee-Hill gets plenty of coastal fog and coolness, providing this gamy, silky 100% varietal wine with structure and buoyant acidity around a balanced weight of tar, black olive and dark cherry.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sourced from the family's Animo Vineyard atop Atlas Peak, this Cab comes from the highest-elevation blocks on the vineyard, some 1,350 feet up. Ripe plum fruit flavors surround savory elements of black tea, the structure well-honed and age-worthy through 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is so overripe that it tastes like Port, with raisin and milk chocolate flavors, and a hot, spicy finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Despite its power, this is so elegant, showing tannins, minerality and generous flavors of black fruits, dark chocolate and spices. The smooth and rich surface belies the inner taut texture, showing how the wine will need many years to finally come round.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This has enormous richness and intensity, with penetrating aromas of leather, tobacco, spice, dark fruit and dark chocolate. On the palate, it's inky, rich and supersmooth. This is one of the best Italian wines ever made from the difficult 2003 vintage.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rich and complex, this dry, terroir-driven wine completely avoids the sweet butter creaminess and jamminess of so many Chardonnays, showcasing instead notes of tropical fruits and pears. It's framed by minerals and even a fresh herbaceousness that suggests the wild plants growing around this Sonoma Coast vineyard. While the oak influences are strong, they are perfectly in keeping with the underlying volume.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The small Mazoy\\u00c3\\u00a8res-Chambertin Grand Cru creates structured wines with plenty of texture and tannins. This is brooding, firm and very concentrated, with its fruit set way behind the dark tannins and spice note. It will take at least 10 years to start to mature.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is so dry, minerally and richly complex, you'd swear you were drinking great French Chablis. Brisk acidity and a steely stoniness give the apricot and citrus fruits a backbone of iron and iodine. Oak is there, but subtly lurking in the background, lending a hint of buttered toast. A beautiful wine, classy and upscale for drinking now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very structured and firm, this has the weight, richness and power that is typical of Ech\\u00c3\\u00a9zeaux. It's the tension between the tannins and the ripe black fruits that give this wine its great aging ability and depth of flavor. It needs at least six years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Following an unfortunate Chanson white wine style, this wine is totally dominated by new, high toast wood. It shows freshness, but the acidity comes from the wood, leaving the structured fruit way behind.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Typical for Pomerol, this is a tiny property of seven acres. It is situated on the plateau close to Pomerol village center. It presents a bold display of Merlot, full of ripe tannins and jammy red berry fruits. It's dark, rich and maturing well, and will be ready to drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tannic and structured, this combines 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Merlot, with a leathery, earthy fist-print of black fruit imprinted on the wine. It's big boned but not out of balance and can stand some time lying down, through 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Certainly it is firm, with impressive power. But the smoothness of the ripe black fruits as they combine with the beautifully judged wood show a contrast of tension with the dense, chewy core. At its heart, this wine is dark and solid and concentrated, promising long aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Classic Lynch-Bages with just a bit of extra power and richness. While the tannins are structured, it is the velvety fruit that rolls around the mouth that is the most dominant character. It is coming together into a wine that will be big and dense, but never over the top.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An aristocratic, perfumed wine dominated by delicious Cabernet Franc. Beneath this elegant exterior, there is also power from intensely concentrated fruit and tannins. The wine is already well integrated, the wood only here by feel, balancing so well with the fruit. To finish, sweet fruit and dusty tannins combine easily.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Typical of the huge power of Guiraud, this is one of the richest Sauternes in 2005. The wine is rich and intense, the dry edge of botrytis just dominating the sweetness. Flavors of honey, almonds and peaches give the wine extra complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: About as good as it gets in terms of a powerful, fully oaked modern wine that still guards its core identity while offering plenty of straightforward drinking pleasure. San Roman in 2004 is a high-speed train with agile fruit and bracing acidity more dominating than, say, tannic might or alcoholic heat. Among the brave new world of modern wines from Toro this is one of the very best. 6,500 cases produced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Under the control of white wine wizard Denis Dubourdieu, this is one of the great wines of Barsac. It has intensity of sweetness, but just the right lightness, which gives it freshness as well as richness. This is a great wine in its early stages, and is certainly likely to age over many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is opulent, but with restraint. The fruit is rich, black and delicious. Touches of spice and wood are present, lending complexity to the ripe fruits and balanced tannins. Impressive.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Everything is here in this great wine. The solid fruit flavors are of black berries and dried raisins, and there is a rich, powerful structure. Above all, it is finely balanced. It shows that a wine can be powerful without being high alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stature is K-J's top Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, and can come from any of the winery's vineyards. The '03 hails from Atlas Peak, Mount Veeder and Knights Valley. The wine is immaculate and impeccable, with impressive black currant, cedar, pencil lead and smoky vanilla aromas and flavors that finish with a great deal of complexity and interest. So balanced, so lush, it just dazzles. Drink now through 2012 or thereabouts. Winery only.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The tannins dominate this dark, brooding wine. At this stage, it seems to have closed up, leaving the fruit and acidity buried. But with this concentration, the future looks promising. There is a long aging potential here.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard has never produced anything less than great Cabernet, and Surh Luchtel, who buys grapes from it, has a great track record. As always, the '05 is stunningly rich and refined. It shows powerful flavors of cassis and minerals, which come from the grapes, and the most tasteful overlay of toasty oak. Fine now, and should hold for a decade.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a 100% varietal wine grown entirely on the producer's estate. Aged nearly two years in all-new French Nevers oak, it shows a tinge of smoke\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094campfire nearly\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094from the barrel, followed by a reduced expression of blueberry and herbes de Provence. Firm, integrated tannins don't distract.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe black-skinned fruit, bell pepper, dried herb, French oak and balsamic aromas lead the nose on this 100% Merlot. The ripe concentrated palate offers dried blackberry, raw cranberry, espresso, vanilla and a confectionery note alongside firm, grainy tannins that leave an astringent mouth-drying finish. Give the tannins another year or two to soften, then drink up to enjoy the remaining freshness and fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This big-boy red combines 30% Cabernet Franc with 20% each of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, adding 15% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot for an all-five red-Bordeaux-varietal blend. Coconut flakes and vanilla-hugged oak ride sticky tannins to a quick finish, offering huge ripeness along the way.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a hearty coming-together of Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah. It dances in baked plum and raisin as a tartness of cherry and savory dried herb counterbalances the rich ripeness and sizable tannin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, this is a rich, softly tannic and delicious wine. It brims with jammy blackberry, dark chocolate and sweet cedar flavors, in a sweetly chewy texture that hints at further ageability. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: . This rich and opulent blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot delivers an intense bouquet of chocolate, cherry, blackberry, spice, nutmeg and polished stone. The wine ends with firm, biting tannins and flavors of chocolate essence. Give it three to five years of bottle aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a beautiful and rich blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot that shows the best of Bolgheri Superiore winemaking. There's opulence and sophistication here with tones of wild berry, chocolate, tobacco and polished stone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows a great return to form over the 2006, with the lush flavors and rich attractions of the 2005. With soft but complex tannins, the wine immediately appeals for its wealth of blackberries, black currants and plums, enriched with smoky oak. Very rich, pure and refined. Fine now, with a good decant, and should age well for a decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stocky, dark and pure, with inky aromas of shoe polish, black fruits and charcoal. The palate is brawny and tannic, with saturated blackberry, espresso and bitter chocolate flavors. It's rowdy but also attractive and full of everything good including chocolate, spice and pepper on the finish. Drink from 2011 through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Straightforward and already accessible, this opens with aromas of rubber, coffee, vanilla, toasted oak and plum cake. The extracted palate delivers mature black cherry, chocolate, and sage alongside evolved, fleeting tannins. Enjoy through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Burly tar and campfire aromas pick up floral lift from lavender on this Syrah-dominant, relatively high-alcohol blend. Grilled meats, creosote and asphalt flavors power the slightly rough-edged palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The winery's largest-production Cabernet Sauvignon and that's still minuscule by most standards, this lovely wine is lean in firm tannins and dark plum, with a sprinkling of coconut flakes and vanilla. Spring for the single-vineyard offerings for a fuller experience.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rapture is Michael David's small-production Cabernet, blended with a small percentage of Petite Sirah, then aged 17 months in French oak for a full-bodied figure. Purple-black in color, it's mouth-filling, jammy and extracted with flavorful blackberry and cherry fruit and a streak of vanilla and fig on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Beeswax and dried chamomile flowers, baked apple and lanolin, lemon rind and a touch of honey: while these aromas are rich on the nose, they become even more bountiful on the palate, filling mouth and mind with their high-wire acrobatics that teeter between steely precision and decadent richness. This late harvest style shows off Riesling's aromatics to great effect. The finish is incredibly zesty and fresh. While this is already evolved, it shows no signs of tiredness and is sure to delight for years to come. Concentration and balance are phenomenal. The haunting aroma of lanolin gets under your skin. Drink now through 2030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The nose is still closed and gives away little. The palate has a voluptuous shape but comes tightly corseted: all is present but still closely held. The peachy fruit has a serene easy sweetness that has its perfect counter measure in orange and Meyer lemon freshness. This is poised and sweet but countered and cut by immense freshness. The aromas have yet to unfold fully. Both blood orange and peach lurk promisingly. It is the seamless poised texture of this late harvest that stands out, along with supreme purity. Wait for this. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00942035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose suggests utter generosity of ripe juicy pear fruit. The palate enforces this with rounded, aromatic and very pure notes of ripe Bartlett pear. The flavors are precisely drawn, framed by incisive freshness that corsets the richness and gives it a beautiful outline. There is barely concealed strength here and great energy. You can feel the warmth of the sun that ripened these lovely grapes. The finish is lasting and dry. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00942030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Youthfully wound up yet fleshy, this wine slowly opens to reveal a sense of crispness, wet stone-like minerality and a taste of fog from the nearby Pacific Ocean. Apple skin, Meyer lemon and key lime flavors provide upfront freshness; toasted oak and almond qualities add substance and weight.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dr. Jan Krupp's signature wine, this boldly blends 36% Tempranillo with red Bordeaux varieties, all mountain-grown on rocky soils. Brown sugar, red cherry, clove and meat flavors contribute to its density, packed into an integrated frame and finishing on a rich chocolate note. Enjoy 2024\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932034.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lightly charred, toasty berry aromas come with a full covering of clove and baking spice scents in this plush wine. The palate is edged with drying tannins, bolstering exotic berry, spice and herbal flavors. Its long, balanced finish features chocolate and unabsorbed oak. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a smoothly crafted, delicate blend of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc. Its ethereal nature does not preclude plenty of quiet power, which provides a sturdy foundation for the bright cassis and raspberry flavor. Subtle spice box, cedar and cigar add to its complexity and length.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a deep, layered, tannic Tempranillo from an intense vintage. Its blackberry, black plum and cedar aromas are broad and lush. Chocolaty oak flavors enwrap its ripe blackberry fruit, remaining rich and long on the finish. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blood orange and peach snatch your senses at the very first whiff. The aromatics are disarming but no longer heady: this has matured into a sober pleasure that's full of peaches scented with passion fruit and barley sugar. The flavors swirl and soar, the luscious sweetness anchors them deftly. This is what a combination of time, fruit and a sugar can do. This is a very sweet late harvest style, suited to fruity desserts.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mocha cream, pencil shaving and dried herb aromas are set against a backdrop of black currant fruit in this big but balanced bottling from the Daou brothers. It's soft on the palate, where the texture commands as much attention as the flavors, in a matrix of mouth-coating tannins that frame its cola, cocoa, black plum and cherry notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red currant, vanilla, toasted oak, coffee and chocolate aromas lead the nose and follow through to the dense, full-bodied palate. It's one-dimensional but muscular, with ample, velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The flavors of blackberry and cherry jam, mocha and sweet toasty oak mark this wine, which was grown in St. Helena.

The wine will age well and will be better after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In this wood-aged wine, the spice and toast show well against the ripe fruit. It's complex and rich while retaining a strong, fresh and herbal character. The wood aging means that the wine has some aging potential, so drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This apple-crisp wine has tight acidity and touches of wood rounded out by yellow fruits. It is ripe and very full, the nervy, mineral character contrasting with the richness that is now developing. It will age slowly, so don't drink before 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a powerful, ripe wine, touched by its wood aging while having rich yellow fruits and a dense structure. Nervous tension comes from the acidity and the strongly mineral texture. It's a magnificent wine that needs aging, so drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Structured and focused, this gorgeous wine offers enticing scents of pressed violet, woodland berry, baking spice, tilled soil and leather.

A white almond note closes the long, lingering finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh and ripe, this also has a strong steely character. Mineral and densely textured, it's a powerful wine, showing ripe yellow fruit, spice from wood and considerable concentration. Moreau makes just three barrels of this wine. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: In 2012, Gaja didn't bottle his single-vineyard crus because they didn't reach his high quality standards, and many of the grapes from these celebrated vineyards finished in this elegant, firmly structured wine.

Enjoy 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, resin, exotic spice, steeped plum and a balsamic note lead the way on this robust red. The firmly structured palate offers raisin, dried cherry, licorice and coffee framed in tightly wound, close-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend from different Premier Cru vineyards in Beaune. At this stage, it is dominated by the wood aging. That gives a bitterness to the wine that needs to soften and allow the ripe fruit to come out. It does have potential, although the maturity will take time. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Zonin's 2006 Amarone opens with very ripe aromas of raspberry and strawberry jam followed by spice, leather and tobacco. Those raisin and dried fruit flavors appear again on the palate, pushed forward by the wine's thickness and soft sweetness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stalky underbrush, celery, eucalyptus and oak-driven spice aromas lead the nose. The bracing palate offers raw cherry, licorice, coconut, toast and espresso alongside a backbone of assertive, drying tannins that clench the finish. Let the tannins soften for a few years then drink to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Smoky berry, lemon peel, graphite and huge black-fruit aromas provide a stellar opening. Raw tannins and staunchness create a powerful palate that needs time to mellow out. Flavors of loud oak, black fruits, hard spices, toast and licorice finish peppery, tough and with some heat. Best from 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Grown in one of the valley's best vineyards, it's eminently ageable. The flavors of black currants and minerals are intense and fine, complexed with new French oak. However, the strong tannins will jacket the wine for a long time before they begin to fall out. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2024, and it could be awesome in 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with a drop of Merlot, this Cabernet Sauvignon remains deeply tannic and dry. It has classic flavors of black currants, anise liqueur and minerals, with quite a bit of acidity. It's complex, compelling and still far too young. Give it until 2018 to begin to come around, and it will be gorgeous in the mid-2020s.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Prunaio delivers aromas of prune, rum cake and cherry liqueur. The fruit is dark and savory, and there's an aged, almost gritty quality to the mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Twelve different parcels provided the grapes to make this Puligny-Montrachet. It's rich and round, and it has a minerally structure and a touch of crisp acidity. The vintage has given a sense of shape to this white- and yellow-fruit-flavored wine. The finish bears a lemon-zest tang.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This 100% varietal wine from the famous vineyard is appropriately bold, brawny and big-boned. A full-bodied expression of ripe, baked cherry fruit, its has a soft and supple texture and additional characteristics of leather saddle, cedar and black pepper.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this brawny, full-bodied wine evokes tobacco, coconut and cherry cola, the flavors commingling within a frame of taut structure and moderate acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This attractively perfumed wine shows the structure of Pommard without pushing too strongly.

Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with native grape Zibibbo, this offers aromas and flavors of rose petal, peach, orange zest and a hint of sage. Refreshing acidity brightens the savory palate while a touch of sea salt signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tender subdued nose gives hints of honeysuckle and ripe mirabelles. The medium-sweet palate lets the stone fruit speak even louder but a pleasantly bitter phenolic edge provides a frame for the juicy sweetness. This is rich and generous and has a lovely tang of tangerine on the warm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is shy but suggests a little development. The palate is fresh and has developed autolytic notes of bread and brioche with a touch of lemon and ripe apple. This is rounded, harmonious and grown-up with rather fine fizz and a restrained dosage. Lovely as ap\\u00c3\\u00a9ritif but serious enough to with subtle food. Lovely, clean, balanced and lasting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Iris, wild berry and a whiff of camphor aromas lead the nose. The tightly wound but straightforward palate offers raw sour cherry, cranberry, crushed herb and dark spice notes alongside bright acidity and assertive, rather grainy tannins. Drink after 2023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: In its antique bottle, this wine (one of a limited series) is laden with more wood than fruit. It will certainly soften, allowing the black fruits to come through, but this amount of wood will be hard to balance out. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This marches to the beat of its own drum, presenting a different style and bouquet than the average Amarone. In fact, this is thinner and more streamlined, with plump blackberry and boysenberry tones that are backed by moist earth and tobacco accents. It shows a feminine side to one of Italy's most powerful reds.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The ripe yellow fruits and wood aging work together in this rich, full-bodied effort. The acidity lends a refreshing relief as the wine rolls around on the palate. Drink in a year.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alluring aromas of violet, rose and dark-skinned fruit lead the way on this elegantly structured wine. The firm palate delivers young red cherry, white paper, grilled herb and pipe tobacco alongside fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This forward wine opens with aromas of dried plum marinated in spirits, fleshy black cherry, baking spice and chopped mint that follow through to the warm, full-bodied palate. Velvety tannins support the rich flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, rose, leather and baking spice aromas come together in the glass. The structured, juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, licorice, roasted herb and tobacco alongside firm, velvety tannins. Still young and bracing, give this a few more years to fully develop. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of forest floor, espresso, toast, blackberry and dried Mediterranean herb lead the nose on this full-bodied, forward blend of Carignano and 10% Syrah. The round, concentrated palate doles out ripe black cherry, red currant, spiced blueberry, coffee and ground black pepper alongside a firm backbone of velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This creamy wine has a really ripe character. Acidity comes from the cooler location of the vineyard, while the warmth of the summer shows through in the yellow fruits as well as in the fresh, crunchy red apples. A textured edge conveys minerality and leaves a fresh, clean taste in the mouth. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine, produced from 80-year-old vines on the Dupuy family's property, is firm and dense. It has new wood aging that shows in the juicy eucalyptus flavors and touches of mint. The youthful blackberry fruits and the structure show the wine has considerable aging potential. Drink this concentrated wine from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fine craftsmanship is evident in this Sardinian blend of Carignano and Syrah. The wine is rich and extracted, with bold fruit notes of blackberry and plum followed by spice and tobacco. Some toasted oak influences appear in the mouth alongside soft, smooth tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As Belgrave improves each year, it reveals a character that is close to the elegance and style of Saint-Julien, right next door. This 2010, while dense, is balanced, and its rich blackberry flavor is already integrating into its firm tannins. This should age well for the medium term.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sweet oak, vanilla, plum, violet and mocha aromas lead the nose on this structured wine. The oak influence carries over to the palate together with ripe black cherry, leather and baking spice. The tightly compacted tannins need time to unwind. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As its name implies, this wine comes from chalk soil, giving both a strongly mineral character and ripe tropical fruit flavors. It's rich, full in the mouth, dry but with such a ripe character there seems to be some sweetness. It's impressively full and ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Daou brothers' considerable and continual investments is evidence that their wines will matter for years, ensuring a wise investment today. This 70% Cabernet Franc and 30% Merlot offers aromas of blueberry and cedar. Once sipped, the tannins grab with strength before dissipating smoothly. It's a seamless combo of spice, fruit, wood and herbs, but will evolve through at least 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Muted black plum teases from the nose of this wine, a blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Amidst a wall of dusty tannins still needing time to soften, you'll find clove, blackberry and a treasure trove of chocolate and vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich while also structured, this is beginning to be delicious. Acidity comes from the black currant fruits while the structure shows dense tannins and wood-aging flavors. The wine is still young and prepared for a long haul, so don't drink before 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a pretty fragrance of violet, exotic spice and perfumed berry. The juicy palate doles out ripe black cherry, crushed raspberry, freshly ground pepper, mocha and anisette. It's nicely balanced with fresh acidity and firm but polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barbaresco exemplifies a light and traditional expression of the Nebbiolo grape with direct intensity and vertical delivery of dried spice, oregano, vanilla, forest berry and white cherry aromas. The wine is delicate and feminine but watch out for that thorny, brambly edge on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Giribaldi's Barbaresco is smoky and warm with layered tones of exotic spice, cola, leather, tobacco and leftover espresso grinds. It has gritty, earthy, hands-on appeal thanks to what can best be described as rustic charm (it is aged two years in traditional oak casks). Drink it with boiled meats and mint sauce.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vigna Broglio is a ripe, jammy Barolo with bold notes of mature cherry and blackberry preserves. It tastes more like a Tuscan wine than one from the Langhe and offers syrupy fruit flavors that indicate a hot vintage or a low altitude vineyard. It's soft in the mouth, however, and offers very smooth tannins. Drink 2012\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bricco delle Viole has a thorny, slightly nervous personality that needs a few more years of cellar aging before softening. Aromas include dill, dried herbs, turmeric, forest berry and bramble. The mouthfeel is sharp and polished with bright berry nuances and crisp acidity. Drink this wine with cream- or butter-based dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Let the conversations about minerality begin. Whatever it is, or wherever it comes from, it's here big time, adding a lick of steel and a metallic mouthfeel to the underlying fruit. And what powerful fruit it is, ranging from orange and guava to honeydew and citron. This bone dry, crisp Chardonnay is a game changer that will make you look at California Chardonnay differently.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This delicious blend is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Syrah, sourced from the Old Stones vineyard. Young, tight and peppery, it gains briary boysenberry flavors as it opens up, along with hints of soy and umami. A streak of maple syrup richness fills out the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: As with previous vintages, this rare wine spent 38 months in barrel. Smooth and supple, it's a lush expression of purple and black fruits, generously endowed with darker flavors of smoke, tar, soy and licorice. There is a compelling, yet subtle, umami character overriding all else. It's drinking quite beautifully now, but could age considerably longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One sip is all it takes to be blown away by this Pinot's beauty. It's exquisitely crafted, a testament to both the vineyard and the winery's oenological talent. The palate is bright and tangy with acidity, and incredibly complex flavors of wild berries, mushrooms, balsam, cola and Asian spices. It's dramatic now, but will continue to improve for at least 15 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The most notable thing about this Pinot is its intensity of flavor. A blend of both new Dijon clones and older California selections of Pinot Noir, it is stunning with flavors of raspberries, cherries and Dr. Pepper. It's a balanced, elegant wine with vibrant texture , but needs time to truly shine. Hold till at least 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a solid, concentrated wine from a reliable chateau. It has weight and power, with rich black fruits balanced with fresh acidity. Touches of bitter extraction and wood aging are likely to integrate as the wine ages. It should develop into an impressive and powerful wine. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this opulent wine opens with aromas of black currant, graphite and baking spice.

Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This new project from the heights of Atlas Peak involves Steve Matthiasson as both viticulturist and winemaker, having had to take over the reins from the late Denis Malbec. It shines in bristling acidity, dusty tannin and a beautiful floral aroma of violet. Notes of chocolate, fig and cigar sit atop a pillowy, complex structure, while vanilla lingers on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of crushed berry, fragrant purple flower, dark spice and a balsamic note almost jump out of the glass. The full-bodied structured palate delivers dried black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice and a hint of clove set against a backbone of firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this linear red opens with inviting aromas of pressed violet, iris, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of cake spice.

This is a big, broad expression of Sangiovese with tart cherry flavors and slightly astringent tannins. You might want to give it a few more years of aging to mellow out but whether the aromas will hold over time is uncertain.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The secret to this wine's quality, according to the producer, is to play Mozart non stop in the vineyards. Like the classical pianist's music, this wine displays both high notes and low notes, but with a beautiful, fruit-forward bouquet and a lean, crisp feel in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a slightly meaty or stewy quality to this wine that gives it a bold and savory personality. The wine shows slightly jammy notes of cherry and strawberry with touches of leather and tobacco at the back. That overt ripeness seems limited to this vintage of the wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cherry liqueur and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis give this Brunello a bright and polished personality. Crisp berry tones are followed by tight, nervous acidity that renders a sharp and steely feel in the mouth. The tannins are firm and compact.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is rich with tannins and a little heavy on the palate with massive, concentrated flavors of blackberry jam, licorice and mocha. Delicious in that classic Napa way, if lacking a bit of finesse. Seems best now and over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Exceptionally ripe and forward with blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam flavors, this wine is accented with hints of savory spice and a smoky jacket of oak.

Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A soft, ripe style of Pinot Noir showing cherry, raspberry and brown sugar flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Drink this fruity young wine now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark extraction and concentrated fruit set the stage. The wine has soft touches of blackberry fruit and plump cherry that are inevitably followed by tight tannins and sharp acidity. This is an astringent, firm wine that should be paired with fatty foods.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black olive stars in this supple, soft and supremely varietal wine, wrapped in strong, chalky tannin. Full bodied and completely generous in ripe fruit, it shows complexity and lengthiness on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very wound-up aromas of dried and dark red berries and asphalt show on the nose of this bottling from Temecula, another sign that Italian varieties can thrive in the warmer climate. The flavors are impressively deep and spicy, with black currant, blackened berries, pencil shavings, vanilla and char.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Having spent multiple years in barrel, this iconoclastic producer's take on the variety is refreshingly real and different: big boned and yet sinewy and elegant in its way. Eucalyptus and bay leaf compete for attention on the nose around an herbal core of cedar and current. The wine is softly layered and well structured.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nuits Saint-Georges is the home of the Aegerter family and its Domaine. This ripe spicy smoky wine is rich both from the vintage and from the core of tannins that are typical of the appellation. It is a smooth rounded wine although it will need some aging.

Juicy, rich and concentrated, this is worth aging for at least five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows ripe fruit aromas of cherry and blackberry backed by leather, smoke and teriyaki notes. Thick and smooth, it has a velvety, fruit-driven finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a touch of playful sweetness as the bouquet begins to evolve in the glass, recalling sweet raspberry and wild blueberry.

Considering the labeled alcohol level, the flavors are surprisingly sweet and rich, with a lightly tacky feel and a drawn-out finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A vivid yellow-gold color grabs the attention and creamy, tropical fruit flavors deliver the goods in this medium-bodied but full-blown wine. Pineapple, grapefruit, fig and almond are layered in an almost unctuous texture, but supported by vibrant acidity that keeps everything in great balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, rose and anise aromas mingle in the glass. The firm palate is still closed, but offers raw red berry, menthol, sage and anisette. It's still rather primary but has the structure to evolve and develop complexity.

Its black, smoky fruit is ripe and rewarding, enveloped in velvety texture and buoyed by moderate acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Delicious, with pleasurable flavors of milk chocolate, cherries and dried red currants, as well as the sweet toast of oak. The tannins are wonderfully pure and complex, in the Napa style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made solidly in the modern cult style of fruity ripeness, softness and rich oak shadings, this inaugural red from Gary Heck is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend with a splash of Sangiovese. It has complicated layers of blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate. Quite delicious in primary fruit flavors, it could well be an ager.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dried fruit, chopped herbs, dusty mineral, sweet apple and cinnamon spice characterize this fragrant wine from Mount Etna. It's less intense in the mouth but would make a good pairing to wild mushrooms or beef carpaccio.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged in 60% new French oak and made with a good dose of malolactic fermentation, this Chardonnay is dominated buttered toast and popcorn flavors. It's an opulent style of Chardonnay, but obscures pleasant flavors of tropical fruit, pear and apricot.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Stoney Vine vineyard, this shows the effects of a cool vintage on young vines. There's a lot of citrus and pineapple throughout, and the berry fruit flavors, characteristic of Syrah, are present in the background. There are pleasing accents of carpaccio and peat moss, and just a hint of Bourbon from the third-use, Wisconsin oak barrels. This definitely needs extensive breathing time, or further bottle age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense from the start, with ripe berry, plum and a pinch of lemon peel on a studly bouquet. This is a healthy, vibrant, modern wine with lots of life and balance; it's drinkable now and will give toasty black fruit flavors and chocolaty warmth. Or age for up to another five years to gain more subtleties.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A sweet blend of red Sangiovese grapes and white Trebbiano (aged nine years in small caratelli barrels), this thick dessert wine very much resembles Tuscany's Vin Santo. It opens with dense concentration and a copperish color with deep aromas of butterscotch, toasted almond and gingersnap.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A brut-style sparkler, at the age of eight years it's still fresh and crisp, with yeasty flavors of limes, strawberries, vanilla and toast. Feels dry and austere despite a honeyed richness, just what you want in a great sparkling wine. Seems best over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An interesting and even a bold wine that will challenge diehard California Pinot lovers. The wine is quite low in alcohol and exceptionally silky and light in the mouth, with an elegant feeling. It's strongly extracted in raspberry fruit, and has lots of sharp, zingy acidity. Doesn't feel knit together at all, but could be a sleeper. Try aging until 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and soft, it offers a ripe cushion of Chardonnay and a warm, rounded personality. While it misses out on a more structured character, the yellow fruits and light spice from wood aging give immediate drinkability.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rich, ripe expression of appellation fruit, densely concentrated in thick swathes of chocolate and black currant. Deliciously approachable, it shows structure and grace alongside its powerful foundation, with room to age. Enjoy best 2020 through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh tropical fruit, peach and apricot flavors star in this flashy young wine. Oak also plays a prominent role, giving buttered toast and caramel notes. And the texture is creamy and smooth. The overall impression is very rich and powerful, but the wine could have more finesse. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a fine, ageable Pinot Noir that's dry and crisp with acidity. It exhibits a mushroomy earthiness that frames strawberry, cranberry and cola flavors. The window of drinkability begins in 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petit Verdot, this robust wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, mature plum, toast and roasted coffee bean.

Astringent tannins provide support.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This robust wine features aromas of stewed plum, damp hay and anisette. These carry over to the warm palate, along with dried fruit flavors and the heat of evident alcohol that throws it off balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% varietal wine was aged entirely in French oak and given plenty of time in bottle. It opens with a burst of coconut flavor and light cedar and currant accents, feeling structured yet light on the palate and juicier on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tangy boysenberry and elderberry fruit shows on the nose of this sultry bottling, along with thyme, potpourri and licorice. The flavors are more cooked than fresh, recalling charred blackberry, dried blueberry, leather and licorice. It's a hearty wine that consumes the entire palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine includes all five traditional red-Bordeaux varieties, Merlot the most dominant, resulting in tart Bing cherry and cassis flavors. It doesn't hold back on tannin or power, showing grippy persistence on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of grapes from Mario's Vineyard and Central Park West Vineyard, both in St. Helena. Full bodied and voluptuous, it offers classically tuned touches of cedar, dried herb, lingering red cherry and cassis. Sizable tannins give it plushness and depth. Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stemmy on the nose, this is a juicy, almost carbonic wine, spritzy in acidity and appealing in its bright, refreshing take on the variety, a buoyantly light mix of raspberry, cherry and cedar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Relentless is Shafer's Syrah-based red wine. It's always rich, ripe and bold, and the 2009 is no exception. The alcohol is very high, making the wine heady and warm. If you can get past that, you'll find a huge wine, massive in blackberry, plump raisin and chocolate flavors, with soft tannins and a long, sweet finish. The blend contains 18% Petite Sirah.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rich and voluptuous on the bouquet, this has coconut, ripe blackberry and leather aromas. It feels huge, grabby, tannic and supercharged, with ultradark and chocolaty berry flavors that last long on the finish, where pepper, spice and chocolate flavors sneak into the frame. Drink 2014\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Every intervention available to the winemaker for creating richness has been applied here, including 75% new French oak. California Chardonnay hardly gets more extravagant in buttercream, smoky toast, lemon drop, apple butter and pear flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Grown in one of the coolest areas of the appellation, yet it's so rich and full bodied, it almost has the body of a red wine. Don't let it get too cold, and pay attention as it warms and evolves in the glass.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite the less-than-stellar vintage, this is excellent, with dark berry aromas, earthy grit and complexities that rise to the occasion. It feels big, fresh and fruity, with racy black-cherry, chocolate and pepper flavors. Elegant, correct and complete; drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This low-production Pinot Noir is dry, silky and enormously complex, with cherry pie, Dr. Pepper, bacon, anise and white pepper flavors, plus a woodsy suggestion of pine needle. Oak aging adds the perfect touch of smoke. Good as it is, it should improve in the bottle over the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This limited-production, aged wine incorporates 8% Merlot, sourcing grapes from several vineyards across the Napa Valley. Blueberry pie and sweet tobacco rise to the fore around an elegantly crafted structure, while soft, firm tannins provide just enough grip to stay juicy and compelling on the palate. It finishes with notes of chocolate, caramel and baking spice.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A bottling celebrating the winery's 30th anniversary, this offers roasted coffee, nutmeg, star anise, vanilla bean and cinnamon spice atop the pure black-cherry fruit on the nose. There is a tremendous and delicious density of black-currant fruit once sipped, leveled by graphite, espresso foam, cola, cream soda and vanilla-bean flavors, held in place by chewy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sizable portions of caramel and honey play off the nose of this inviting wine, which reveals elements of baked apple, grilled pineapple and a tangy, spicy undercurrent of acidity. Structured, layered and complex, it has more to show within its integrated layers and long length.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rose, lavender and forest provide the opening notes of a lovely, concentrated, still-evolving wine, its density and concentration offset by a beguiling brightness of acidity. Strawberry, cranberry and nuanced suggestions of cinnamon and clove play off each other until a toasty finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's lots of espresso, roasted coffee bean and toasted wood on the nose that carry over to the palate along with black plum and vanilla. But there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the astringent wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak, sweet vanilla, chocolate and plum cake aromas take center stage. The aromas carry on to the palate but there's not enough fruit to stand up to the oak or the astringent wood-driven tannins that leave the mouth feeling dried out.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine begins with aromas of oak, coffee bean and toast. The palate lacks fruit richness, offering instead dried tobacco leaf, oak extract, espresso, dried sage, vanilla and mocha alongside bitterly astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky in toasted oak, this textured, layered wine has a full body and considerable length, highlighted by chocolate mocha and black cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Released a year after their spectacular Sea Slopes bottling, this small production Pinot shows the elegance of the far Sonoma Coast, and also the ageworthiness of a fine wine. Dry and crisp, it has deep flavors of cherries, pomegranates and persimmons that are fresh and tart. It will have no trouble negotiating the next six years, growing earthier and more complex.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very fine wine with sweetness tempered with a great sense of structure and concentration. Lychees dominate the fruit profile but are supplemented with pineapple and pomelo flavors that are sprinkled with pepper. It is rich and full in the mouth. It needs some more time to age, so drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard is located in the western part of Sonoma County, near the little town of Freestone. The cool 2011 vintage lends mouthwatering acidity to the wine, brightening flavors of red apples, pomegranates and persimmons. Right now, it's juvenile and tight, with primary fruits that are unintegrated with oak. Give it at least eight years in the cellar, and it could be going strong at the age of fifteen.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There's a fine wine hiding inside this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, which contains Cabernet Franc and Merlot. But its qualities are buried beneath strong tannins. The fruit is impossibly young, all jammy cherries and blackberries, and new oak sticks out in the form of buttered toast. It's all very imposing, so don't even think about drinking it anytime soon. Should begin to blossom around 2018, and will be going strong for another decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of estate-grown Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a juicy, liquorous wine wrapped up tightly around sweet and tangy blackberry and cherry fruits. The tannins are svelte and the finish long, while the barrel aging brings on substantial flavors of cedar, Bourbon and vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ultra-ripe, this Cab is decadently tasty, but not really dry. It's almost as gooey soft and sweet as a dessert pastry, with flavors of pie crust, chocolate pudding, sweet blackberry jam, currants and licorice. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A lovely Cab for drinking now and over the next few years. Shows a classy structure, with rich tannins and ripe fruit flavors of black currants, mocha and cinnamon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This boasts a classic nose of red berry, forest floor, spice rack and a balsamic note. The full-bodied palate delivers juicy red cherry, mature strawberry, clove, grilled herbs and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins. An earthy note of truffle closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A deep, dense concentration of black cherry and berry provides richness and juiciness to this wine, the fruit wrapped around velvety waves of full-bodied texture and a supporting wall of oak. Earthy licorice and black tea appear on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark fruit, leather, tobacco and spice aromas lead the way on this elegantly structured red. On the palate, notes of cocoa, vanilla, anise and espresso accent a core of fleshy black cherry, while firm, fine-grained tannins provide support. A licorice note signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine dazzles with detailed aromas of black currant, plum, herbs, cassis and earth along with barrel accents. The palate is wound up tightly at present but still accessible with layered, seamless fruit flavors along with a lengthy finish.

The full-bodied palate offers juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, coffee, white pepper and cinnamon framed in firm, fine-grained tannins that lend elegance and structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alluring scents of perfumed berry, underbrush, pipe tobacco and leather come together on this firmly structured wine. The palate delivers mature black cherry, crushed raspberry, sage, rosemary, clove and a hint of cured meat. It's extremely well balanced thanks to assertive, fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ground pepper, tilled earth and black-skinned berry aromas all come together on this generous, full-bodied red. The fresh, delicious palate doles out ripe black cherry, black currant, licorice and clove alongside vibrant acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This inky, concentrated bruiser opens with lemony oak, graphite, earth tones and deep black-fruit aromas. Like the nose, the palate is intense and ripe as Tinto Fino gets, with smooth, manageable tannins. Flavors of blackberry, prune, cassis, lemon rind and tobacco end with power, class and depth; drink from 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The spicy, evocative scent of Seville orange peel entices from the first sniff. The palate is dry, restrained and sylph-like but with time reveals tangerine and lemon zest. This is a feast, a celebration of citrus flavors, unfolding and shimmering at every moment. This is dry but faceted, taut but playful. Irresistible now but with a brilliant, aromatic and totally seductive future ahead. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tightly wound, layered, moderately tannic and oozing excellence, this is a fantastic high-end Toro from the superb 2012 vintage. The minerally, toasty aroma of blackberry is stylish and shows a balsamic note. Flavors of licorice, sweet balsamic vinegar, chocolate and toasty blackberry continue on a long, deep, complex finish. Drink this ace-level red from 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed. But those subtle aromatic hints and a concentrated, stony palate promise future pleasure. This will blossom into a perfumed marvel. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The subtle, rounded but rather aromatic perfume of peach skins and apricot compote on the nose is utterly seductive\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094there is a promise of oriental riches and exotic spice but above all pure, glowing peach fruit. The palate is in total focus: while some residual sugar illuminates every last vestige of fruit, there is guiding central force that never lets this slip into the merely opulent. A masterful tightrope walk amidst plump fruit and mineral precision with a finishing, pleasantly bitter edge of marzipan.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The initially sumptuous notions of peach are quickly tinged by a more intriguing note of smoke. Honeyed notes join in before they explode on the palate into a rich, lemon-caramel flavor. This has concentration and verve and cuts its sweetness admirably, so much so that this becomes a lip-smacking tightrope walk of lush, sweet caramel and tight, spritzy lemon zest. Exciting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a muddled element to the nose here that recalls old wood or spice and in general, this wine lacks sharpness and focus. It tastes very sweet and offers high alcohol that keeps the palate ripping clean.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rounded wine, this is a blend of different premier-cru vineyards in Beaune. It packed with raspberries and red cherries. The acidity, typical of the year, is restrained here by the ripe fruitiness. Tannins give the wine just the right amount of support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is tight, nervy and crisp, with a strongly mineral texture. There is good acidity, crisp and textured. Apples and citrus dominate this structured wine. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rich wine with good citrus and crisp apple flavors. It is textured, spicy and has a tight character. The wine is still very young, with a light hint of wood that adds toastiness to the saltiness of the wine. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With structure and some firm tannins, this wine is on the dry side. It has black fruits that will develop over time, and certainly show now with a juicy background. The acidity is refreshing even through the solid tannins. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine takes time to unravel and reveal itself, rewarding the patient with a wealth of high-toned citrus and elegantly wound, medium-bodied honeyed pear and caramel. Lengthy and complex, it's one to consider aging and allowing to further mellow over time. Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in the modern style, this Cabernet is dark in color, soft in acids and tannins, and enormously fruity.

Drink now-2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% estate-grown Syrah remains obstinately hard and tight, with a strongly tannic streak.

It has the weight of a Chardonnay.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a violet color and charred aromas of oak, shoe polish and black fruits, this amounts to a very good, woody blend of Carignan and Garnacha that's as healthy as an ox but hits like a bull in a China shop. Blackberry, burnt toast and dark chocolate flavors finish spicy and hot, while rubbery tannins esure that this has a grabby grip. This should improve with additional bottle aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bouquet of white flowers kissed with honey and stonefruit, this ebullient ice wine bounds from the glass with its sunny, sweet pleasures. It's delicately textured, but penetrating with pristine tropical fruit flavors that linger.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There is a sense of extraction and long wood aging with this bitter, chocolate-flavored wine. The palate has a dark plum-skin fruit character and a dry, hard-edged core. It will need at least six years to mature.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle aromas include crushed flower, forest floor, graphite, black berry and a note of menthol.

The palate offers plum, black cherry, roasted coffee bean, spearmint and vanilla alongside bracing tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of fresh violet, blue lilac, mint, menthol and orange zest take center stage. The ethereal fragrance doesn't carry over to the palate however, which displays oak extract, dried cherry, espresso, dried sage and roasted coffee bean alongside bitterly astringent wood tannins that dry out the mouth and generate an abrupt finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toasted oak, coffee, underbrush and a hint of fig. The full-bodied palate shows oak, espresso, hazelnut, dark pepper and clove but not much fruit. Assertive tannins grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine has no added sulfur, giving crisp, clear and clean fruitiness. It also adds an light touch of oxidation that broadens the wine and makes the white stone fruit richer. Drink this impressively ripe wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Matured in large wooden vats, this is a wine that is so ripe and rich. With great fruit allied to an opulent texture, it is both spicy and full of tropical fruit flavors. At the moment, it is just bursting with fruit and will need time to calm down, so wait to drink until 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a wood-aged wine, named after the founder of the Mellot dynasty in the 16th century. It is richly endowed, packed with fine white fruit that contrasts with the stony steely texture. There is a great tang of acidity and orange zest at the end. The wine is still young and will repay cellaring until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromatic herb, woodland berry, violet, citrus zest and tilled soil scents take shape in the glass.

Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink before the remaining fruit dries up.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big, rich and complex, this is a Cabernet you want to lay down. Tasted in the late Fall of 2013, it's tannic, oaky and dry, brimming with spectacularly ripe blackberry, cherry and cassis flavors. The alcohol is a bit high, giving the wine some heat, and yet the balance is so good that the wine should easily develop over the next eight years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this wine starts with scents of blue flower, plum, leather and spice.

The combination of nuttiness, fruit and freshness is very convincing, harmonious and moreish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Obviously the producer thinks this is an important wine judging by the unusually heavy bottle.

This fine wine will be ready to drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firm with dark tannins, this is a structured wine. It is still reticent, likely to take several more years to show its fruit. It is dense with the black-plum fruit behind the firm tannins. With all this concentration, expect this wine to need at least until 2024 before drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in sizable quantities, this impressive wine should please a wide range of palates in its mix of restraint and hearty structure.

Drink this wine, from a small Grand Cru close to the village of Aloxe-Corton, from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine has plenty of fruit, but even in the open 2013 vintage, it is still firm, structured and with nervy minerality.

Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Notes of burnt caramel hover above the glass but on the palate precision reigns. A frame of earthiness and zest still shrouds the fruit.

Those include the wine's gorgeous renderings of small forest fruit, Spanish cedar, cigar box and rum cake. Breathtaking in evolution and intensity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Jammy, creamy and superripe, with raspberry, burnt toast and coffee on the thick, meaty nose. Flavors reminiscent of an ice cream sundae work the palate, which means berry syrup, chocolate sauce and vanilla are highly prominent. Texturally speaking, this is a smooth, soft and plush wine. It pushes the envelope on ripeness, but that's become the Cirsion way. An awesome wine that deserves a proper decanting.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The 2004 Solaia is dense and concentrated with loads of character and defining aromatics: plump blackberry, chocolate fudge, exotic spice, peppercorn and smooth balsam notes. The real pleasure comes in the mouth where it delivers smooth elegance and an extra long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blockbuster wine with finely tuned renderings of coffee, tobacco, spice and leather, Oreno requires a rare steak cooked on a mesquite grill or something similarly big and bold.

Best after 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full in the mouth, this rich wine is dominated by yellow fruits and ripe apricots lifted by a touch of toast.

The palate shows dried black cherry, coconut, licorice and roasted coffee bean alongside fine-grained tannins. This isn't a classic Nebbiolo but it's polished, balanced and will appeal to those who enjoy oak-driven sensations.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense and extracted, this opens with aromas of roasted herbs, leafy underbrush, vanilla and plum cake. The syrupy palate offers blueberry extract and sweet baking spices framed by grippy tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Packaged in an extremely heavy bottle, this features aromas of mocha, vanilla, mature black plum and grilled sage.

Tart acidity offsets the fruitier aspects, dotted with black pepper and leather flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy cranberry and cassis characterize this Cab, given ample time in bottle.

Enjoy after 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of red berry, baking spice, violet, tobacco and a funky whiff of game. The smooth palate delivers dried cherry, raspberry jam, cocoa and carob accompanied by velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Preston Vineyard sits near the original site of Niebaum's original plantings for Inglenook, and also near the vineyards of Beaulieu Vineyards. Thick and rich in blackberry and espresso, this wine exudes its proximity to vigorous, big-boned sites, yet retains the elegance and herbal-cedar notes of the vintage, dusted in peppery spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo shows overripe berry aromas punctuated by orange peel, balsamic herb and toast notes. While the palate offers ripe black fruit, spice and big, round tannins, it's somewhat evolved. Drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tastes candied at this time, offering a myriad of raspberry and cherry jam, red currant and caramelized oak flavors. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, with additions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's a rich, satisfying wine, but a little underwhelming for a Dominus wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is not your standard Moscato d'Asti. This sophisticated expression benefits from high density planting in the vineyard and the fruit is fermented in special French barrique for extra creaminess. On the nose, this sparkling dessert wine is redolent of apricot, pineapple and honey.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Giuseppe Rinaldi awes and amazes with the Cannubi-San Lorenzo-Ravera Barolo, but is slightly less successful with this wine from the Brunate and Le Coste crus. The wine is lively and fresh but is also less intense on the nose. The mouthfeel is dominated (at this early stage) by thick, bitter tannins that will no doubt soften with time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 2004 Barolo Riserva opens with a brownish-ruby color and aged aromas of dried currants, exotic spice, old leather and root beer. It shows tight but   polished tannins and offers a drying mineral edge on the close. Don't wait too much longer to drink this wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very fruity Cabernet in which blackberries, black cherries, currants, licorice and cola star, along with oak influences. It's bone dry, and the tannins are thick and firm, but finely ground. Jammy and immature, the wine wants time in the cellar. Hold until after 2013 and see what happens.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and varietally expressive on the nose, this Cabernet Sauvignon is softened by the addition of 15% Merlot, the two combining in layers of ripe plum and tobacco. With mouthwatering acidity and firm tannins, it offers a complete package of enjoyable, approachable Cabernet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From 7.5 acres of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a rich wine, very perfumed and with layers of ripe fruit. It is lightly structured, full of red berries with a firm tannic character in the background. Under winemaker Olivier Dauga, the wine needs to age but has all the fruit potential there. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mint, anisette and red berry aromas lead the nose. These follow through to the palate along with licorice, espresso, coffee, toasted oak and black pepper. It's tightly framed with drying wood tannins, but the bright fruit stands up to the strong oak influence. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright, dusty leather is a highlight of this structured, meaty, balanced wine, firm and grippy in tannin. Red berry and coffee complement each other to find a tension between fruit and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Funky in spearmint and a carbonic notion of freshness, this wine offers cranberry and barely ripe strawberry, adding to its sense of delicacy. Mild shakes of white pepper play on the palate, as the finish finds a bolder weight of tannin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in tiny amounts in a light-bodied style, its vineyard site in the cool Petaluma Gap, this wine opens in earthy soapstone and sandalwood, offering an aroma of dried flowers. Delicate acidity supports a funkiness of cranberry, rhubarb and nutmeg, while a suggestion of roses lurks in the background.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dry and tannic, this has a baked quality to its fruit, tasting warm and raisiny.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of exotic spice, forest floor and a balsamic note emerge in the glass while the full-bodied palate doles out ripe red cherry, cranberry, licorice and clove. Assertive, rather grainy tannins and bright acidity provide support. It's still rather austere so give the tannins a few more years to unwind.

The flavors deliver, with a sense of understated appeal.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From 20-year-old vines, this bottling shows strong cedar, crushed graphite and charred wood on the nose, with a hint of blackened pasilla chile. Pencil shavings play strong on the palate, spicing up the elderberry and black-currant fruit, with pinches of oregano adding depth. The tightly wound tannins are quite sticky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A hearty addition of 19% Malbec and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon contribute to this wine's complexity and soft, round profile of hearty tannin and oak.

Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe with a core of dry tannins, this is a typical foursquare Nuits-Saint-Georges. Structure gives shape to the black fruits and acidity that are developing well. Already in balance, it will be drinkable from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticingly perfumed, this is full of red cherry and plum fruits that are cut through with intense acidity. A dry core of tannins both gives support and promises aging. Structured while packed with fruit, it should be drunk from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of white flowers, baking spices, pear and a whiff of toasted nuts waft from the glass.

The palate offers mature black cherry, mineral, licorice and saline alongside polished tannins. Enjoy soon to capture the fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Tuscan Merlot opens with dominant aromas of raw wood and wood chips with hints of black fruit muffled beneath the surface. Oak is also at the forefront of the palate, followed by toast, espresso and vanilla. There's not enough fruit richness to carry off the oak, and it finishes on a bitter note of astringent wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The cherry, red currant, cola and oak flavors are delicious on this bone-dry Cab. Structuraly, however, the wine is so soft that the palate searches in vain for firmness and grip to complete the flavor experience.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subdued aromas of menthol, cassis, clove and sunbaked earth slowly unfold in the glass.

Here is a cellared Riserva with darker concentration and heft followed by broad aromas of tobacco, leather, spice and plummy fruit. Mineral notes and cassis play a part and the wine needs some time in the glass to fully open.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine opens with a luminous garnet color that is typical of young Barolo and segues to aromas of wild berry, road tar, black truffle, leather and cigar box. It shows well-evolved mineral characteristics on the palate and offers a blast of bright berry fruit over firm, chewy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gramolere (a vineyard in Monforte d'Alba with excellent orientation and soils) offers wide sweeping aromas of spice, cherry, red apple and white mushroom.

This is a thick and highly tannic wine with alluring notes of beef jerky, hickory, root beer and black currant that would pair with important meat dishes. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This warm, robust expression of Sangiovese opens with aromas of underbrush, scorched soil and mature black-skinned fruit. The densely extracted, monolithic palate offers blackberry extract, coffee and black pepper alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. It lacks fruit richness and freshness. You'll also notice the heat of evident alcohol on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This ripe wine shows plenty of blackberry fruits balanced well with some dry tannins.

It is immediately attractive, although the structure and final tannins do promise aging potential.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here's yet another excellent wine from this modern-leaning Riojano producer. The nose is full of spice, tobacco and deep berry aromas. Feels quasi-jammy and very rich, with thickness and mild tannins. Tastes baked, like a mix of prune, spicecake and chocolate. Warm and figgy on the finish, and ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With zesty acidity, ripe raspberry and cherry flavors and just a touch of overripe raisins, this Cabernet-based blend is very oaky. It's not likely to age so drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tannic while also fruity, it shows the structure of 2010.

A wine that could age, it will be better drunk from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's full-bodied and tannic, with upfront blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors. Doesn't seem like an ager, drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A balsamic nose of menthol and sage comes along with notes of exotic incense, black plum, cola and ginger. The palate offers muddled flavors of prune, black currants, fennel and grilled red peppers contrasted by sensations of sugar-sweetened espresso. It doesn't have enough fruit richness to support the very evident alcohol.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Powerful, with tannins that are seamlessly woven into the fruitiness, this is a rounded, ripe and concentrated wine. The berry fruits and the juicy damsons are as important as the generous, soft texture. The wine will develop over the medium-term; drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Based in Nuits Saint-Georges, Manuel Olivier understands the appellation well. That is shown in this bottling that manages to combine the structure of a Nuits wine with dark fruits and a juicy texture. It's rich while also firm.

Great acidity cuts through the structure, giving freshness to the naturally dense character of this Grand Cru wine. It's for aging, but not for too long, so drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Well structured, this combines ripe red fruits with a firm texture. It has a good concentration and a mineral, terroir-driven character that shows through in its dry core. The juicy acidity at the end gives a lift, but the wine needs to age. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Every Burgundy merchant seems to have a Clos de Vougeot. The Aegerter's version is relatively light, as much fruit as tannins even while it is young. Berry fruits comes forward, while the layer of tannin is in a supporting role. It's a solid wine, not one that has a long future. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Estate-grown and bottled, this is the winery owner's ode to his mother, and the highest-end white he makes.

Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas suggesting scorched earth, cassis, porcini mushroom and grilled bell pepper. The firm austere palate offers dried black currant, prune and star anise alongside tightly knit, close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Sauvignon and Chardonnay, this has subdued aromas of toast and orchard fruit. The linear palate is on the lean side, offering yellow apple skin, oak and a hint of citrus. It closes on a bitter-almond note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and cocoa.

It shows huge density and richness on the palate, with ripe prune, blackberry and currant notes. This Carignano would pair with barbecued pork.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gentle and silky, this Pinot Noir has perfumes of rose petals, ripe red cherries, flat cola and sandalwood, plus a hint of grilled bacon. It tastes as sweetly delicious as it smells, and it feels round, supple and polished. So easy to drink now, but you might miss the complexity if you do.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of oak, toast, licorice, coconut and sugared plum.

It's ripe, round and ready, with evolved tannins and soft acidity so drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Restrained, smooth and soft, this vineyard-designate is pillowy on the palate while remaining satisfying and expansive in juicy red fruit. Holding 25% Merlot, it offers undercurrents of dried herb and coconut flake atop quiet oak and is a beautiful wine for the table.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of perfumed berry, pressed rose and violet emerge on this elegant, structured wine.

A bombastically dense and concentrated wine, it's gamy, meaty and brawny all around. Black fruit, tar and tobacco combine to full-bodied effect. It would be best to wait on this one, cellaring through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find classic Nebbiolo scents of perfumed berry, rose, violet, tilled earth, leather and a hint of game in this striking wine. On the palate, notes of sage, white pepper and clove accent a core of red and black cherry.

Give it greater structure, and the score would soar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dried roses, violets, lavender, red currants and cranberries describe the nose of this beautifully delicate and complex wine. It tastes tart but also slightly sweet with chewy succulence and polished tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied wine pushes the concept of ros\\u00c3\\u00a9 to its limits.

A mineral element in the texture emphasizes the dry yet rich nature of the wine. Drink from 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the top cuv\\u00c3\\u00a9e from Sainte-Roseline (you can tell from the weight of the bottle). It has power, a smooth texture and a rounded aftertaste. The red fruits are well integrated into the rich texture. It would be worth aging this until the end of 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black cherry and smoke beef show on the nose of this study of Pauillac, as do tobacco ash, leather and crushed black gravel. Dill, oregano and thyme give nuance to the dark red and black fruit of the palate, from black plum to dense mulberry. This needs a bit more time to reach full potential, but should cellar well. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tightly coiled in fruit and oak, this is a young yet vibrantly lush, plush and juicy wine.It's ready to expand on the palate as it opens to reveal exotic baking spice, textured velvety softness and swathes of black cherry and pomegranate.

While it's already enjoyable, drink it after 2018 for more complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cascina delle Rose is one of the denomination's brightest gems and its Rio Sordo is a textbook Barbaresco.

The palate delivers cassis and truffle notes, with layers of Alpine herbs. While tannic, the wine is surprisingly forward.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This best barrel selection is deep, dark and delicious, with classic Napa blackberry, currant and cassis flavors.

Give it until 2017, and it should provide great drinking well beyond that date.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Claudio Fenocchio's classically crafted Barolos are consistently outstanding even in tough vintages. His flagship Bussia delivers succulent black cherry, truffle, leather and balsamic sensations balanced by big but fine tannins. This is already developing some complexity. Imported by Masciarelli Wine Co, Moonlight Wine Co.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a delicate wine with a very Margaux feel.

The palate delivers dried cherry, prune, ground pepper and licorice alongside tightly-knit tannins. The heat of alcohol shows on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Concentrated and powerfully structured, this features aromas of plum cake, blueberry, vanilla and baking spices. The palate delivers prune, raisin, crushed blackberry and white pepper but the searing alcohol sensations throw it off balance and give it a one-dimensional quality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This firm wine fits well with the image of Pommard. A tannic core contrasts with the potential of the red cherry fruits. Wood aging is still prominent, and the wine needs time to balance out. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Pinot Nero sparkler conveys varietal aromas of rose petal and red berry. On the palate, crushed raspberry notes back up ripe red apple alongside brisk acidity and a lively perlage.

Lingering fruitiness makes it lovely to enjoy, as the oak remains a background player in full support of the succulence and ripe power. Still young, it should continue to open further over time.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's red berry, fragrant blue flower, aromatic herb and new saddle leather scents lift out of the glass. The firm palate offers juicy Marasca cherry, raspberry compote, cinnamon and anise notes set against tightly wound tannins and vibrant acidity.

Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Seems a bit hard and lean for a \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009899, especially a reserve. Pretty tannic now, although there's some blackberry fruit at the core. Oak provides additional nuances of smoke and spice. Hard to tell where it's going.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This savory and meaty red wine is made from air-dried Nebbiolo grapes much in the same style as Amarone. It opens with thick tones of pipe tobacco, smoked bacon and dried blackberry fruit.

Subtle on the nose, the savory character gives way eventually to a density and concentration of brighter flavors, from cherry and citrus to spiky pine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the third bottling of this wine, which employs whole-cluster fermentation to provoke a slower ferment and mellowed tannin. It succeeds, though it doesn't hold back, showing plenty of firm tannin backbone seasoned by clove, black tea, sage and anise.

It forms part of an 18-acre estate belonging to Sergio Rossi. It is a stunning wine, with a sense of fine poise combined with solid tannins and firm, ripe fruit. At the back of the palate is a lingering flavor ofviolets and sweet herbs. Drink from 2005; the wine should age well.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Little changes at Biondi-Santi. The tannins on this huge 1997 are dense, almost impenetrable. The flavors are of cherry, tobacco, old wood and solid, black fruits. The aftertaste is all tannin at this stage. Despite this rigorous adherence to tradition, the 1997 seems a touch less overwhelming than previous vintages of this classic wine. Nevertheless, age for at least 15 years before drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a little-known producer outside the Classico zone, here is a pretty wine with notes of cherry, chocolate, spice and subtle shadings of vanilla.

There are some hints of stem and green olive in the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing some of the richness and structure of Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e, this is a concentrated wine, spiked with wood aging while also full of dark plum fruits.

Drink from 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The grapes for this 100% Sauvignon Blanc are sourced from estate American Canyon vineyards as well as an estate plot in Carneros. The result is intense in oaky apple skin and tropical, fleshy lime and guava. Large French oak casks were used for aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is one dark, intense Ribera del Duero with loads of lush black-fruit aromas matched against minerality and fine French-oak scents. It is tight as a drum on the palate, with wiry acidity and rocky tannins. Flavors of oak-driven coconut and cream sit on top of blackberry and cola, while the finish ends abruptly, with hardness. Drink through 2024; 150 cases made.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Quite a good Cabernet, pure and intense in varietal characteristics of black currants, but balanced and elegant. The tannins are smooth, the finish complex and long in spices. Delicious as it is now, your best bet is to cellar this Cab for 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years, and possibly longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend is very rich in chocolate, blackberry and cherry fruit.

This one shows a rich, rounded approach that never gets overly ripe, instead embracing a sanguine, savory profile of cranberry and red currant wrapped in toasted oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Some years, even the top wines suffer, and in a cold 2013, Alion is not what it normally is. For starters, this is far more tight, tannic, raw and pulling than its track record. Toasty oak is a big player, creating creamy aromas and toast on the finish. In between are crisp, peppery blackberry flavors. This wine may improve with time. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of scorched soil, used leather and game. The aromas follow over to the funky palate along with mature plum and black pepper. It's already accessible, with evolved tannins. Enjoy soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wood aromas are repeated on the palate with a dry bitterness. This wine should soften as it develops, although that over-enthusiastic use of wood could remain. This is one of several Bordeaux estates owned by Andr\\u00c3\\u00a9 Lurton.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a mature red wine from Maremma, Tuscany with ripe notes of cherry, chocolate, prune and black plum followed by exotic spice and spicy mesquite flavors. The wine is sweet, round and slightly jammy in the mouth but washes over the palate with generosity and intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blockbuster, blustery wine, 30% whole-cluster fermented, with a wealth of concentration and oak. Earthy and funky on the nose, it's soft, ripe and dense, with a hearty mix of cola spice and juicy black cherry, offering lots of dry tannin on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, sawdust, oak-driven spice and tobacco aromas emerge in the glass. It's still tense, with tightly packed tannins and fresh acidity that backup flavors of oak, toast, espresso, licorice and cherry steeped in spirits. It's shy on fruit richness, making the alcohol noticeable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hard as nails in tannins, with mouth-numbing astringency. But the powerful fruit explodes right through, offering an array of blackberry jam, dark chocolate, raisin and anise flavors. Try cellaring it until at least 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Massive essence of Cabernet Sauvignon, a triumph. Shows huge waves of blackberries, black currants and cassis, dark chocolate, earthy minerals and considerable oak, which is tasteful and unobtrusive, With its dryness and perfect balance, it will easily negotiate the years. Should be fine well past the year 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Conteisa is a Barolo-inspired wine from Angelo Gaja (with 8% Barbera) that opens with very attractive and approachable aromas of red fruit, tobacco, leather, moist earth and black licorice.

The wine will be at its best after 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A marvelously intense wine, the Chardonnay singing with light toast and acidity.

Five percent Barbera is added and the wine shows amazing harmony and sophistication with bright acidity and firm tannins. It will only become more beautiful in time.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Grand Cru within a Grand Cru is a magnificent, opulent wine. It has all the power of a great white Burgundy, the richness allied to minerality and then given weight by toast, yellow fruits and a pure, straight line of acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The magnificent wines from the Marquis de Laguiche estate are produced by Joseph Drouhin. This Morgeot is rich, intense, beautifully concentrated. It has toast, apricot and peach fruits to go with its tight mineral texture.

Made from 100% Cab, and aged in 100% new French oak, it is, in a word, splendid. Rich in blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, the fruit was clearly well grown, and the tannin-acid balance is utterly classic. This beautiful wine is a partnership between three well-known and high-scoring vintners from other brands. It is a winery worth following.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lots going on in this mountain-grown wine. It's perfectly dry and strong in tannins, with an elusive quality of excellence that testifies to the best terroir. Showing blackberry, black cherry, mineral and oak flavors, it should develop bottle complexity for at least the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine offers an austere entry of crunchy red fruit akin to cranberry and pomegranate. Accents of clove and leather ride along toward a lengthy finish of broad expansion and balanced strength.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of black-skinned berry, leather and cedar. The dense palate delivers black currant, espresso and clove alongside bracing tannins that leave a somewhat astringent finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Just a touch less lively than the 2002 and 2005 versions, Hugel's 2001 Gew\\u00c3\\u00bcrztraminer SGN is still excellent, boasting plenty of weight and richness allied to distinctive varietal aromas of rose petals and cracked white pepper alongside the dried apricot notes of botrytis.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Riserva Brunello shows sharp, brambly characteristics of forest berry and white cherry. Although the nose is prickly and awkward, the wine wins points in the mouth thanks to its softness and plushness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with toast, ground pepper, grilled herb and sawdust aromas. The palate is firm with grippy tannins but expressive, evoking sour cherry, roasted coffee bean, oak and star anise.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark-skinned berry, French oak, aromatic herb and a whiff of dark spice come together on the nose of this firm red. On the palate, roasted coffee bean and star anise notes accent wild cherry fruit, while close-grained tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this offers black tea and mature plum aromas, while the palate evokes dried cherry, clove and star anise flavors. Firm, close-grained tannins generate an austere finish. Give it another few years to soften, then enjoy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy cranberry and cassis characterize this Cab, given ample time in bottle. Soft and medium in terms of weight and body, it's fluid in fruit, with a leathery finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry and clove aromas are elevated by a hint of lavender on the nose. These notes carry through to the palate as well, along with a grape soda flavor. Smooth tannins and ample acidity struggles to match the larger body. A hollow midpalate leads to a tart fruit finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is fresh, crisply fruity and toasty without missing the apple and pear flavors that give juiciness behind the texture. It's ripe and is developing well. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine offers tropical fruit against a background of intense acidity. That makes it fruity, ripe with a tight structure that gives delicious lift and freshness. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of red berry, espresso and a whiff of sawdust. On the palate, raw red cherry is backed up by licorice, toast and roasted coffee bean but it lacks the fruit richness needed to stand up to the oak and the youthfully raspy tannins which leave an astringent finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With the next two vintages both damaged by hail, 2012 is the most recent normal crop from Pommard. This structured and solid wine seems to have an excess of wood at this stage, although the ripe red berry fruits do give a more generous character. The tannins, typical of Pommard, kick in\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094although not enough to spoil the fruitiness. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh and fragrant, this offers aromas of rose and violet with a whiff of woodland berry. The elegant palate delivers bright red cherry, crushed strawberry, clove and peppercorn alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Feels heavy and soft, with ultraripe blackberry and cherry flavors that have a raisiny, Port-like quality. The tannins are beautiful, as they always are in Pride wines, and the finish is dry and complex. Could surprise, but doesn't seem like an ager.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This 10-year-old wine from a hot vintage is soft and plump but has gaps in its fiber. The mouth is tannic around the edges but lacks stuffing, while flavors of plum and berry run jammy and heavy. A hollow finish with prune flavors and dry tannins is the final act.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a vineyard 1,000 feet above Annapolis owned by Thomas Rivers Brown and Fred Schrader, and farmed by Ulises Valdez. It demands time to open, concentrated as it is in juicy blackberry, plum and a hit of earth, the tannins integrated and silky soft.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a six-acre site further inland than many of the producer's other sources, this wine shines in classic coastal expression nonetheless. It presents a mix of earthy, stemmy forest and black tea, with a touch of reduction and lightness of oak and power. Delicately textured, it delivers a refined style.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The winery's top of the top, this is a viscous, concentrated expression of the grape, blended with 5% Merlot, the fruit from the producer's estate Sage Vineyard on Mount Veeder. Chocolate, blackberry, sage and meaty grips of black pepper and anise compete for attention amid all the ripeness and intensity, finishing with surprising softness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The slightest notes of vanilla accent the pear-fruited nose that also carries hints of saffron. The palate is defined but balanced. Fruit concentration partners with gentle richness and spice, with the necessary counterbalance of citrus pith and zest. Lovely now, this elegant wine will develop. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of toast, oak and cherry. The tense palate offers raw red berry, roasted coffee bean, oak-driven spice and powdered sage, yet lacks fruit richness. Abrasive tannins give it a bracing finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo, this offers black tea and mature plum aromas, while the palate evokes dried cherry, clove and star anise flavors.

Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of savory leather, wood and baked berry fruits lead to a fresh, well-built palate with fine tannins and integrated but potent acidity. Toasty, blackened plum and berry flavors finish with a coating of oak flavor as well as coffee and chocolate notes. Drink through 2028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bright magenta color and aromas of toast, tobacco, cola and wild blackberry draw you in. This wine is young, and so the acidity shows through right now. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and black cherry come with a touch of oaky vanilla. That vanilla carries over to the finish, which is oaky, bright and scouring. This Carignan-Garnacha blend will be at its best from 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is showy on the nose, with lilacs, lavender-laced cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9e and dense dried-black-cherry aromas that prove inviting. It is elegantly framed on the palate, with lots of lavender, potpourri, dried thyme and oregano set against the rich, dark-red fruits.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with earthy, almost funky aromas that recall new leather, tilled soil, truffle and a whiff of game.

A cheerful spice element comes through on the mouth thanks to overtones of crushed clove and black pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The celebrated Poggio alle Mura Brunello delivers hearty masculine richness and deep layers of sassy spice that are offset by plush blackberry and cherry nuances. The wine shows solid structure that will soften with careful cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An impressive wine, beautifully structured, never too powerful, very elegant.

Drink 2018 through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Massolino's Parafada Barolo is a stunningly beautiful wine with bold, confident aromas of black fruit, tobacco, cigar box, cherry cola, clove, nutmeg and vanilla bean. The mouthfeel is bright, lively, velvety and, generally speaking, the 2006 vintage represents a big jump over 2005.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rocche Barolo is another homerun for Vietti. You'll fall in love with the wine's rich intensity and the ensuing complexity that becomes apparent as the wine spends more time in the glass. Thanks to a continuing evolution, you'll recognize aromas of wild berry, smoke, crushed stone, licorice, cola and mesquite. The tannins are silky and smooth. Hold ten years or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Nebbiolo grapes, with their naturally elegant aromas of black currant and licorice, speak loudly. So does winery magic: Tones of spice, leather, cola and tobacco are derived from 24 months of careful oak aging. The tannins are fine and tight and this wine will age ten years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This eagerly anticipated Drew Bledsoe/Chris Figgins collaboration is a serious effort, dusty, dense, and dark. To begin are whiffs of cinnamon, smoke, cured meat and bacon; then come tight, dry, stone-soaked flavors of cassis and sweet black fruits. Floral highlights elevate the nose, and lead into a finish with delicious accents of toasted nuts, almond paste, and chalk. A dazzling debut.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From a simpatico, family-run winery comes this benchmark Barolo. La Serra speaks highly of the Langhe territory and of winemaking innovation. Aromas here include cherry cola, vanilla bean, leather and crushed granite stone. The wine is determined and direct with a savory note of cured meat on the long finish. Drink after 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Even though the alcohol is a high 15.3% abv, this Cabernet tastes like it still has some residual sweetness. It's as rich and ripe in blackberries, but awkward, and doesn't seem capable of aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, menthol and vanilla emerge. The dense palate offers black pepper, licorice and a suggestion of dried black cherry alongside raspy tannins that leave an astringent finish. Showing the heat of the vintage, the fruit is already drying up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a light-colored wine, with structure and acidity to balance the perfumed cherry-flavored fruit. Still young, still developing its fruitiness, the wine is going to be crisp with attractive strawberry flavors and soft tannins. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From vines situated just under the line of great Grand Cru vineyards, this is a structured wine. It is surprisingly under-powered for the appellation, although its balance is just right. So firm black-plum skins balance a combination of tannins and black-cherry fruits that are topped with acidity. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Offers a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a red plum-fruit core, with caramel and tobacco accents. Aromas are of figs and Indian spices; one reviewer found the fruit a bit candied. This is a very good Cab, drinkable in the near term, though not one that necessarily merits such a lofty price tag. Finishes with bitter chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gritty earthy aromas come up short on freshness and clarity. This feels raw and pinching, with dry rubbing tannins. Gritty peppery berry flavors are oaky, while this finishes with savory berry, herb and tobacco flavors. Hammering tannins suggest decanting and/or service with hearty foods.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spiced plum, truffle, new leather, coconut and oak aromas lead the nose. Taut and tightly wound, the palate offers dried cherry, tart cranberry, espresso, anise and sage notes. Give the tannins another few years to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With spice and wood right up front, this wine is toasty and rich. It has a creamy texture along with bright acidity and a generous body. The wine, with its smooth, ripe aftertaste, is of course young. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of violet, ripe berry, orange zest, toasted oak and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The structured palate offers mature cherry, white pepper, licorice, well-integrated oak spices, vanilla and grilled sage alongside firm, polished tannins. Showing the heat of the vintage, it's a bit warm on the midpalate but it still retains finesse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a Freestone-based vineyard, this wine offers an earthy funkiness on the nose, veering into forest floor, that then evolves into dark cherry and vanilla. A deep imprint of oak is felt on the palate, along with a tart rhubarb-like finish accented by a touch of black pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blue-fruit aromas are front and center along with notes of herb and barrel spice. The palate shows restraint and suppleness that continues through the sweet fruit flavors on the finish. It's an intriguing, stylistically unique offering of this variety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Merlot makes up 58% of this blend, with the balance Cabernet Sauvignon (33%) and Cabernet Franc. A blend of fruit from Anna Marie, Spring Valley, Loess, and Minnick Hills vineyards, the aromas are light, with notes of plum, raspberry, barrel toast and spice. The palate is soft and silky, gliding on the finish. It's all about delicacy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From 100% estate-grown Calistoga fruit, this tiny-production wine is well-composed in compost, grilled mushroom and meaty undertones, the sturdy structure and ripe body robust and integrated.

This wine will benefit from more time in bottle; drink best 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of dried cherry, raisin, oak and a balsamic note follow through to the palate along with a coffee note. Firm tannins grip the finish. Drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While this wine is a majority varietal, it blends in Syrah, Malbec, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, each co-fermented with the Cab. The tannin weight is pronounced, adding to the richness and concentration of blackberry jam and black pepper, the tannins leathery and lengthy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of wild berry, graphite, dark cooking spice and grilled herb lead the nose. The concentrated palate shows dense black cherry marinated in spirits, licorice, clove, toast and a hint of espresso accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins.

The generous palate offers red cherry marinated in spirits, white pepper, clove and anise alongside solid tannins.

Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is modern Rioja in all its glory. The nose is plump, a bit gaseous at first, and full of blackberry, raisin and prune aromas. This feels flush, choppy and oaky, with fine tannic structure. Flavors of blackberry, cassis, vanilla and cream finish subtly and woody, with a lactic aftertaste. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Oak Knoll District and estate-grown fruit, this 100% varietal wine has a substantial amount of vanilla and cherry at its heart. Medium bodied, structured and soft, it retains fine-grained tannins that should mellow in the cellar, through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature dark-skinned berry, toasted hazelnut, espresso, menthol and oak-driven spice meld together in the glass. The concentrated, full-bodied palate boasts succulent black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, vanilla and sage framed in velvety tannins that give this a polished texture. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red berry, game, scorched earth and a whiff of menthol emerge on this full-bodied Barolo.

Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rose, red berry, mint and anise aromas unfold in the glass.

The wine boasts deep, concentrated extraction with aromas of bresaola, smoke, spice, ripe cherry and red rose accents. It's thick and long lasting with slightly textured tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Barolo Leon makes a wonderful first impression thanks to its aromas of ripe berry fruit, Indian spice, cola, licorice and ginger. There's deep dimension and personality here and the wine ends with firmly polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Barolo Castelletto opens with ripe aromas of blackberry and strawberry with background tones of old leather, spice, espresso bean, tar and root beer. There are drying mineral tones as well and the wine ends with young, slightly astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A subtle, complex, utterly distinctive mix of flavors, with opening streaks of butter cookie, then mushroom broth, tightly wound berry fruit, earthy coffee grounds and even darker streaks of espresso and smoke and licorice. It is deeply layered with flavors that just keep piling on. Amazing wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A tremendous wine that shows how Merryvale is absolutely at the top of its game. Impeccable in structure, with refined tannins that are soft and firm at the same time, and a fine cut of acidity. Entirely dry, the Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is awesome in blackberry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, with complexities of anise, soy sauce, grilled meats and minerals. Beyond the particulars, it just feels dramatic and rich in the mouth. A great wine that should develop in the bottle over the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the only Cayuse Syrah that is co-fermented (with 8% Viognier), which adds nuances of white flower and floral, though the citrus rind scents override them. In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions. Mineral, berry, mountain complexity, nuanced herb and earth and citrus, all in proportion, and all flowing in the mouth.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The question concerning this wine isn't whether or not it's very good\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094it is. Instead, it's about ageability. Made from 100% Cabernet grown in two very different places, Pritchard Hill and Coombsville, it's dry and refined. Floods the mouth with blackberry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate, spice and new oak flavors whose richness is tempered by a firm minerality. Really fabulous in all respects, but so delicious now, it makes you wonder why you should even risk more than six years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A huge wine, fat with the characteristic Cayuse funk, and accented with plenty of meaty asphalt. Potent and powerful, bursting with berries and plums, scented with the aromas of earth and sweet (not dried) herb, chicken stock and flavors that run through the same exotic range. Round and full, forward and balanced, drinking well and maybe just a bit rounder than its brethren.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Superb sculpture and definition in this compact and lightly funky evocation of pure Cabernet Sauvignon. The deep, dense, super ripe berry flavors are framed within a bouquet of dried herbs, pepper, mineral, astringent tannins, and a crisp mix of earth, wood and plant flavors. Superb length and ageability.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here's one of the most ageworthy wines of the vintage. A 100% Cabernet, its grapes come from a vineyard in eastern St. Helena, off the Silverado Trail. Cab's usual blackberries and cassis are there, along with classic elements of green olives and herbs, with a funkiness that adds an umami tang. Very finely constructed, very complex, spicy and delicious. Give it six years, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rare Cabernet Franc from Merry-vale, and a spectacular one. They've handled this finicky variety just right, although surely the addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec adds weight and tone. The wine is dry, richly tannic and enormously flavorful, offering waves of cherries, red currants, red licorice, cola, sweet cedar wood and even savory hints of bacon. A tremendous Cabernet Franc that will stand as a definitive version in California.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this Cabernet, which contains a little Merlot. It's rich and lush and authoritative on every level. The texture is soft as velvet, but the tannins are firm, backing up blackberry, cherry, chocolate, cassis, mineral and new oak flavors that are complex and linger long into the spicy finish. Such are the tannins that the wine is likely to age well through 2016, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the oldest block of the estate's Seven Hills Vineyard, this pure Cabernet opens with intense aromas of mountain fruit. Bramble, light herb, cement, black cherry and cassis combine in a polished, elegant wine that probes deeply into the palate. Flavors abound\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094cassis, coffee, licorice and more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Good concentration, with tight-knit purple and black fruit flavors, a streak of espresso, and the characteristic herb and mineral flavors of the vintage. Very fresh, clean, muscular and still compact, with concentrated blackberry fruit that pops up and broadens out in the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Saturated in every way, this sappy, spicy, almost surreal Tempranillo piles on the wild, gamy fruit, the mineral-infused base, the leaf and forest flavors, all around tart berry flavors. Amazingly deep color, fine-grained tannins, a sweetly herbal character, and great balance throughout.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The estate vineyard is in the Vaca Mountains, east of the city of Napa. You can taste the cool climate in the brisk acidity that frames this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's very ripe in blackberries, with rich layers of toast from new French oak. For all the sweet fruit, the finish is dry, even rasping. Such are the tannins that the wine feels tough, even at this age. Give it another five years, at least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The estate vineyard is on the east side of Rutherford, on Howell Mountain Road, up into the Vaca Mountains. This is prime Cabernet territory, and the wine is 100% varietal. It's very rich and dry in blackberries, with a firmly tannic astringency and a fine coating of oak. Needs time to come around. Give it at least six years, possibly far longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rather heavy in texture, a big, full-bodied and tannic Pinot that seems overly extracted and oaky. The vintage was very difficult due to early September heat waves, and everything depended on exquisite timing. It's very good, despite the rusticity. Drink now through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a curious Amarone with a distinct nose of root beer, toasted almond and medicine cabinet. It delivers a well-toned, mellow close with soft tannins and more cherry cola flavors on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a soft, fruity and sweet Cabernet, rich and spicy in raspberry, cherry and blackberry jam. Lots of new oak adds smoky vanilla and caramel notes. It's delicious, but pretty direct, lacking some complexity and structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An attractive Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with varietal aromas of cedar, red currants and tobacco while the palate offers dried black cherry, exotic spice and licorice. It's still tightly wound with firm but fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied blend of 50% Cabernet, 20% Petit Verdot, 20% Syrah and 15% Merlot delivers aromas and flavors of black currant, tobacco, licorice, clove and dried mint. Tightly wound, dusty tannins offer support and need time to unwind. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Year in and year out, Dolce is one of California's greatest sweet dessert wines, and in 2005, it may stand supreme. It's an impossibly rich wine, mainly because the botrytis mold developed perfectly in this fine vintage. Shows fabulous flavors of apricot pur\\u00c3\\u00a9e, vanilla-infused cr\\u00c3\\u00aame brul\\u00c3\\u00a9e, pineapple sorbet and candied ginger, balanced with brilliant acidity. The residual sugar is 12 percent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Long hangtime fruit is the star of this Pinot, which is pretty much as good as the winery's more expensive bottlings, making it a comparative value. The raspberry, cherry, tea, cola and Indian spice flavors developed perfectly in this perfect vintage, giving the wine an elaborate richness, while crisp coastal acidity provides balancing tartness. It wants some time in the cellar. Give it until 2012 to begin to develop bottle complexity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Everything that's fantastic about 21st-century Toro is encapsulated in this big, intense beauty. Tobacco, vanilla and blackberry aromas grace the forceful but stylish nose, while the palate pulses with toasty blackberry, dark plum, tobacco and chocolaty flavors. Smoky, pure and long on the finish. A hands-down winner to drink now through 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tremendous Cabernet, one of the last to come from the great 2007 vintage. Drinking perfectly now, it's a soft, smooth sipper, with lush flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cherries, cocoa and cedar. The addition of Merlot brings a soft, mellowed mouthfeel. Picking up bottle bouquet at the age of four, it will continue to gain traction for many years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tremendous Zinfandel, Ravenswood's most expensive, and while you might quiver at the price, it's easily a very great wine. This is Zinfandel on steroids, a monster of wild summer berry, tobacco, currant and spice flavors, wrapped into significantly thick tannins. Yet despite the power, it never quite loses elegance and balance. The winery's 2007 was their greatest Zinfandel ever, and this one isn't far behind.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With green apple aromas, a bright freshness and a light touch of toast, this is already a balanced, delicious wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mazuelo is almost always a blending grape for a reason: it's limited in depth and weighty. So it's no surprise that this opens with leather, prune and bullish jam and liqueur aromas. The palate, however, is kind of sharp and lacking depth, while the flavor profile is juicy, herbal and folds in cassis and berry. Snappy and acidic for an expensive varietal wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toasted oak, mocha and a whiff of coconut oak lead the nose while the firm palate offers dark cherry, espresso, dried sage and a hint of anise. The tightly wound tannins still pack youthful sharpness and need a few more years to soften up. Drink after 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark and brooding, this opens with aromas of French oak, espresso, clove and mature blackberry. On the extracted palate, licorice, vanilla and sweet baking spice accent a core of baked plum while bracing, fine-grained tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brioche and vanilla-cherry are the stars in this full-bodied yet savory, herbal wine sourced mostly from the Oak Knoll District. Complex in flavor, it spikes in clove and cinnamon, finishing with a taste of gunpowder and tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of dark berry, tilled soil, underbrush and espresso lead the nose while the taut palate offers sour cherry, sage, white pepper and star anise.

The palate is rather extracted, offering rich black cherry, chocolate, tobacco and sweet spice alongside grippy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc, with a smaller percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon also added. Neutral French oak was used to age the blend, which opens with a strong, earthy aroma and a scent of wild blackberry. Soft, it features a twist of licorice on the tangy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of scorched earth, cured meat, underbrush and ripe blackberry. The evolved palate offers coffee, mocha, vanilla, raisin and blackberry extract alongside close-grained tannins. Enjoy sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The deep, brooding nose blends dark purple fruit with black licorice and Chinese black pepper sauce. Sage bark and anise contribute herbal tones to the palate\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094likely thanks to the inclusion of 14% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and blackberries rule the fruit profile.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This powerful Cabernet Sauvignon calls on 13% Malbec to further its brawn, the mix spending two years in entirely new French oak. Hugely muscular, it needs time to calm its masterfully ripe fruit and dark layers of clove spice, and to further soften its tannins and coax out the shy component of herb. The vineyard behind the wine is Bismark within the newly named Moon Mountain District.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas recall fennel, grilled herb, leather, mocha and a whiff of balsam. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, the palate is already evolved but still shows dried black cherry and black pepper. Drink through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sourced from a prime site embedded within the cool confines of Green Valley, this is crisp yet rich, intensely creamy and ripe in pear, lemon and caramel.

The ripe palate delivers fleshy red cherry and black raspberry with layers of cocoa, espresso and sage alongside bracing tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A sad approximation of the old Anthology, whose quality has been sinking in recent years. The \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009805 is not quite ripe, with vegetal notes to the blackberries and sweet oak. It's an okay wine, but this once-fine wine's best days are gone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rubbery, rooty aromas of herbs and berries blend with stalky red-fruit notes. This feels shrill and tangy, with hard tannins, while flavors of roasted berry fruits come with a leafy undercurrent. Roasted, herbal, oaky flavors settle in on a juicy, high-acid finish. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Cranberry and currant aromas come with hints of herbs and juniper. An astringent initial mouthfeel turns more complex with airing. Flavors of berry and plum are roasted and rubbery. It finishes on the grabby side, with chunky tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coffee, mocha, char and roasted black-fruit aromas control the bouquet on this modern Rioja. Lemony acidity provides lift to the palate, which has a raw, abrasive, tannic bite. Flavors of toast, chocolate, lemon rind and black fruits finish similarly, with a chewy texture. Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Known best for its Merlot, Three Palms is also planted to all five Bordeaux red varieties, with each one represented in this wine. Blueberry, huckleberry and a reductive undertone mark this effort, sinewy in tannin and soft at its end.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ripe, earthy aromas of prune, blackberry, baking spices and barnyard set up a rich yet balanced palate with mild tannins and integrated acidity. Flavors of blackberry, cassis and hoisin sauce end with meaty, spicy notes akin to barbecued ribs. Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of berry, cherry and earthy schist are what the Priorat is known for. This wine feels tight and pure, with firm tannins and a gritty personality.

The palate shows both evolved autolysis by way of soy-spiced breadiness and even more fruit in the way of bruised, tart apple notes of great purity. The finish is long and full of flavor, complex, nuanced and resolutely dry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle but enticing scents of pear, citrus zest, pastry and a warm whiff of freshly baked bread lead the nose. The smooth, creamy palate delivers juicy yellow apple, tangerine zest, aromatic herb and a spicy ginger note while tiny, persistent bubbles lend elegance. A bitter almond note closes the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A rooty-smelling nose suggests sarsparilla soda, with accents of oak, malt and baked blackberry. There's just enough energy to the ripe palate, which tastes of earthy, savory blackberry, baking spices and cola nut. A smooth, ready finish revolves around surprisingly soft tannins. Drink this easy rider through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Starting with beautifiul aromas of cassis, cocoa and coffee beans, this wine has a velvety texture and deep, ripe layers of black fruit. It does a great job of combining layers of black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon on a full body but without seeming heavy.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The former basketball star's initial release immediately establishes itself among the elite Cabernets of Napa Valley. Made from mountain vineyards on Atlas Peak and benches in the Rutherford appellation, it combines intensity with elegance. Bursts with upfront, delicious blackberry, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis and dark chocolate flavors that are wildly sweet on the midpalate, but then finish thoroughly dry. Structure comes by way of a tangy minerality and finely laced tannins. This is one of those wines that is softly decadent from start to finish, although it's probably not one to hold much beyond six years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A massive wine, decadent and splendid, and a worthy followup to the near-perfect 2008. Densely packed in fruit, it explodes in blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate, minerals and sweet, toasty new oak. That richness is lifted to brilliance by the tannic structure, which is world class. So deliciously approachable, it's drinkable now, but it should develop over the next 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years. Beyond that, all bets are off, because this modern style of soft, relatively high-alcohol wines has yet to prove itself over the long haul.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A lovely Cabernet, richly attractive and deeply flavored in blackberries, blueberries and black currants. Made from vineyards scattered across Napa Valley, the wine has been blended with a splash of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.

Shows the stuffing to age for 10-plus years, but it's polished enough to drink now, after decanting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with the classic Bordeaux varieties, this is dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon's blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors. Lots of sweet oak gives a buttery, toasty richness. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Woodland berry, new leather, dark baking spice and rose aromas are front and center on this radiant red.

Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing scents of red berry, baking spice, Mediterranean scrub and a hint of eucalyptus slowly emerge. The elegantly structured palate delivers black cherry, licorice, clove and espresso framed in youthfully austere but refined tannins. It's still young and tightly wound but balanced, with bright acidity. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Chewy and delicious, this doles out aromas and flavors of fleshy wild cherry, ripe raspberry, truffle, star anise and pipe tobacco. Round velvety tannins provide support and lend a smooth texture. It's already enjoyable but will age well for several more years. Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This blend of four parcels from different premier crus is structured with all the density of this fine village. Its black fruit gets a fresh edge of acidity, while the tannins are firm and tight. The wine needs to age and will be best from 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With Ribera wines there's an assumption of tannic presence, but this older vintage, while displaying a classy bouquet, is brutally tannic, with an acid-washed palate. Splashes of cranberry and plum flavors are cut by lemony acidity and drying sandpaper tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dry and a little unripe, this has a vegetal streak that compromises the nectarine and citrus flavors. A fine burst of acidity makes the mouth water. The blend is mainly S\\u00c3\\u00a9millon, with a little Sauvignon Blanc.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Corbaia is Sangiovese and Cab Sauvignon from the southern part of Chianti Classico where temperatures are a bit warmer and the soils a bit thicker. As a result, the wine has added structure and power but it also has pretty buoyancy, elegance and lingering aromas of balsam notes, herbs, black pepper and almond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The question is whether or not this wine will age, for it sure is tannic. Burns from entry to exit, and it's not the alcohol, which is modest. It's a very ripe, fruity Bordeaux blend, brimming with blackberry, cherry, licorice and cola flavors, and is flat-out delicious, except for those astringent tannins. Give it until sometime in 2008, and it should drink well for an additional six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a Merlot-Cabernet blend of great intensity and vertical delivery that doles out attractive notes of tobacco, toast, molasses, graphite and pretty herbal shadings. It has big, plump cherry and earthy tones at its core and is ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coniale is all Cabernet Sauvignon. The nose is rich in dimension and personality and delivers quality aromas of spice, tobacco, chopped herbs, almonds and bursting blackberry. It is inky and dense in consistency with a velvety mouthfeel that builds in structure thanks to gritty tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A lively and compact Cabernet Franc, with generous cherry aromas and well-integrated oak. Made according to biodynamic principles, it's thick, rich and full of ripe personality. It's a very likeable wine with a pronounced character from a vineyard that was started in 2000. Drink after 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend exhibits thick density and concentration and direct aromas of blackberry, black ink, cola and roasted chestnuts. The wood is well-integrated, and the wine is juicy and firm on the palate. Drink after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a look at an older vintage of Casalferro (Sangiovese and Merlot) that showcases the aging potential of this super Tuscan blend. Ripe fruit and spice is backed by ethereal tones of cola, licorice, herbs and resin. The mouthfeel is characterized by dusty tannins and a crisp close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The texture is delicately silky and the acidity is brisk and savory. What stars are the flavors. The wine is jammy in raspberries and cherries and a little obvious in its fruit and oak. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The immediate impression is that this wine is heavy, ripe and oaky. Sawdust and wood grain are the lead aromas. In the mouth, this chunky Priorat is hard, with grating tannins. Hickory and toasted berry flavors finish hot and resiny.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of blackberry jam, stewed plum, raisin, roasted coffee bean and fig carry over to the palate along with a note of clove and orange zest. Fine-grained tannins and zesty acidity provide a firm elegant structure. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A sumptuous wine from a vintage that is fruity and generous. It does show some of the structure of the appellation, but the juicy cherry and ripe strawberry flavors dominate. It's going to develop into a rich and early-maturing wine. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Already beautiful and rich, this has power, concentration and many layers of ripe berry fruits. Red plums also come through strongly, bringing in juicy acidity. This dense and muscular wine should age. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a small parcel called Les Mazi\\u00c3\\u00a8res Basses, this is a rare Village wine in an area packed with Premier and Grand Crus. It has power and richness as well as a smooth texture that is already velvety. It's ripe and concentrated, with juicy black currant and berry fruits, finishing dry and firm. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This generous wine is big and full on the nose, with two-thirds new French oak making itself felt in texture and aroma but entirely well-managed, resulting in a balanced wine. Forest floor and earth tones burst on the palate, followed by brambly dark berry fruit, the texture soft to the finish, which offers some grip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The steep, stony slope of the Cul de Beaujeu has produced this firmly structured wine that has rich plum and berry fruits. It is an impressive wine, ripe and juicy. With plenty of youthful crisp freshness the wine needs to age to plumb the depths that are there for the future. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very dark in the glass, this imposing wine shows bacon fat, black cherries, blackberries, allspice and violet-flavored cookies on the lush and layered nose. Once sipped, a silky, luscious mouthfeel conveys blueberry pastry, lavender, black tea and espresso notes, set against a strongly tannic backbone that ensures long aging. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Notes of beeswax, mirabelle plum compote and faint cardamom spice suggest a wine no longer in the first flush of youth. This is a compounded, rich but dry, layered but ultraclean wine. The palate reveals textured notes of gingerbread framed by the ripe fruit of ripe, dried yellow plums and even stored winter apple. There is just an echo of peach on the finish. This has lots of substance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An extremely dense nose reveals espresso bean, blackberry paste, caramelized berries, black pepper and a hint of tobacco, reminiscent of a fruit-laced, heavily spiced cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9e. The blend of 54% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 5% Syrah is silky on the palate with oregano, dill and fennel giving nuance to dried blueberry fruit, laid across a powerful structure. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Amarone has aromas of plum and evident oak. The palate delivers dark cherry, raisin and spice flavors, with chocolate and espresso accents. The dense fruit has easy appeal but the wine doesn't have much personality.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: When a Bordeaux wine gets into a heavy bottle, it has something to prove. As here, when the wine has way too much wood and lacks fruit. It could balance out, but that is a long shot.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The richness and structure of the appellation are well represented in this firm wine. It has dark tannins and hints of wood aging as well as ripe black cherry and berry fruits. With its structure and intense acidity, the wine will age well. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This light-bodied wine sings in bright, citrus-laden overtones, with enough length and complexity to intrigue. Rocky minerality overlays lemon pith and a delightful crispness that makes for a food friendly, celebratory selection.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe, jammy fruitiness gives this wine a generous feel. Packed with opulent berry flavor, it will develop well. It is rich and rounded, nicely supported by the tannins that are in the background. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is produced from 25-year-old vines in the Chambertin Grand Cru vineyard. It is a smoky, structured wine with layers of dark fruits and ripe tannins, with the fresh acidity of the year. Lots of attractive fruit is surrounded by the firm tannins and dry aftertaste. It should not be drunk before 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright and linear, this offers delicate aromas suggesting ripe orchard fruit and bread crust. Made with no added dosage, the vibrant rather lean palate offers mature yellow apple, toasted walnut and a hint of citrus alongside crisp acidity and a firm, continuous perlage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a small Chardonnay enclave in the predominantly red premier cru of Beaune Gr\\u00c3\\u00a8ves. With its intense exotic fruit and apricot flavors, it's both ripe and crisp with acidity. That makes for a delicious reflection of the vintage, needing time to mature. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plummy aromas mix in the glass with whiffs of pressed blue flower, vanilla and mocha. The taut structured palate offers dried black cherry, coconut, licorice, espresso and black pepper while firm fine-grained tannins provide the framework. A note of pipe tobacco closes the tight finish. Give it a few more years to unwind and fully develop. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of new leather, truffle, spiced plum and a whiff of raisin come together on this mature red. The hearty palate is also refined, offering prune, dried black cherry, chewing tobacco, coffee and licorice alongside smooth, velvety tannins. Drink through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of Mediterranean scrub, underbrush, berry, licorice and a balsamic note take shape on this. The aromas carry through to the rounded palate along with juicy cherry, grilled herb, cured meat, clove and a toasted note. Polished tannins provide the framework. It's already accessible and will offer loads of near and midterm pleasure. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the northern end of the Gevrey-Chambertin appellation, this wine is ripe, floral and supple in texture. It has crisp red fruit and vibrant acidity, underpinned by ripe tannins. Developing quickly, it will be ready to drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a fine wine that performs at the level of a premier cru. It has brambly fruitiness and intense perfume. The structure is already finely integrated, allowing the strawberry fruit and acidity to shine through. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fine, ageworthy wine is rounded, smooth and full of ripe yellow fruit. There is a zesty tang on the back palate that will allow it to mature, its richness shining through a frame of crisp texture. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grilled herb, forest floor, ripe plum and leather aromas take shape in the glass. The brawny concentrated palate doles out ripe dark berry, tobacco, licorice and a hint of orange zest while firm, velvety tannins give the finish texture and grip. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Not at all shy, this bold, brash wine will be great to drink with equally bold food. A very dark color and a tempting aroma like grilled baguette slices leads to big, powerful berry flavors, full body, high alcohol, thick but soft tannins and a smoky, meaty finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This has both a rich structure and rich fruit. The tannins comes first, dark and concentrated with spice and a dry core. After it, the ripe and juicy black fruit is layered with dense acidity. Together these two elements make for a concentrated wine that will age. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and juicy, this is a wine with structure and fine, dusty tannins that give it density. The red fruit is juicy, perfumed and has the freshness of the vintage, bright and forward. The underlying tannins are concentrated and will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This austere wine offers some firm tannins over the red fruit. It has acidity, red-currant fruit and a core of dryness, typical of young Pommard, that suggests it will age well. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alluring aromas of ripe berry, violet, iris, baking spice and fennel take center stage on this stunning red. The structured palate delivers juicy red berry, black raspberry, clove and star anise alongside fresh acidity and close-grained tannins. A mineral note energizes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: True to its full-bodied, burly profile, this blend of 89% Syrah and 11% Petite Sirah packs a powerful punch and needs further time to open. For now, a reduced sense of baked coconut, plum and black pepper struggle for identity, with shocks of dark chocolate and velvet. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a modern touch to this wine thanks to its generous and long-lasting tones of espresso bean and chocolate backed by fruity cherry aromas. Beyond those standard characteristics are tones of dried herbs that recall coastal Tuscany. It's huge in structure but should also be ready to drink in two or three years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is not as bulky or dense as others from Bolgheri and boasts a more austere, yet elegant nose. But there's character and depth here thanks to its chewy tannins and long cherry finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Madre is a 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet from one of Montalcino's best producers. It delivers a full rack of spicy aromas as well as fresh fruit and forest berry. However, in this vintage the emphasis is placed on the wine's solid structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As its brawny name suggests, Roccato (Sangiovese and Cabernet) is a thickly concentrated wine with powerful blasts of plum, dried herbs, mint candy, licorice and white talc powder. It's ripe and ready to drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sweet, warm tones of mature cherry and blueberry preserves make for a thick and concentrated wine that leaves a long trail of luscious fruit on the palate. The wood tones are overt and bring notes of vanilla, toasted almond and leather to the wine. Ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A generous body and oak stand out most in this wine, which leans sour in tannin and bittersweet chocolate more than fruit. A forest-floor component keeps it savory, with a taste of yeasty bread.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy blackberry aromas are spiced up by dried-herb, black-pepper and vanilla-bean notes. On the palate, dark berries and toast are accented by earth and green tobacco, and chewy, gritty tannins. Taut red fruit rolled in white and black pepper sums it up. 84% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Merlot, 1% Cabernet Franc, 1% Petit Verdot.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows true Priorat depth and minerality while pouring on the new oak, char and polish. The mouth is ripe and saturated, with intense raspberry, plum and vanilla flavors. Extremely firm and structured, with a hint of bitter chocolate and burnt character. Drink now through 2014. Imported by National Distributing Co., Inc.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The price on this high-flying Rioja continues to go through the roof, and so does the oak and tannin. And while we still appreciate the wine's intensity and power, this vintage pushes so much espresso, burnt nut and rubber that it probably won't impress all comers. In the mouth, look for dark, almost bitter black-fruit flavors followed by a firm, tannic finish. Needs time in the cellar to find more integration. Hold for another year before checking on its status.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon and one-third Merlot, this wine conveys brooding aromas, with notes of dark cherry, herb, anise, toast and gun smoke. The palate has restrained dark-fruit flavors that possess a silky feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Syrah opens with black-skinned fruit, tilled soil and cooking spice aromas. It's soft and dense on the palate, offering ripe black currant, vanilla and black pepper flavors hemmed in with velvety tannins. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tarry, asphalt character shows on this bottling of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, as well as oregano and dark but slightly sour berries. The palate offers charred cherries and charcoal notes, yet the mouthfeel and structure are relatively light.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Gorgeous from head to toe, this saturated Toro heavyweight sets a new bar for this winery and the region as a whole. Ribald blackberry aromas are toasty and carry a strong note of crushed stones. Cassis, black plum and blackberry flavors are complex and inspired, while the finish tastes of chocolaty oak, blackened toast and a black-fruit potpourri supported by just the right amount of acidity. Drink from 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One look, one whiff, one taste and you're swooning. This mature, tawny, ready-to-drink gran reserva with aromas of lemon peel, cedar and dried cherry is the epitome of elegance. A juicy, supple palate is highly approachable, while flavors of vanilla, orange peel, saffron and dried plum don't waver on the finish. Drink through 2027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Subtle smoke hovers above earthy notes and the nose only holds the faintest suggestion of citrus. The palate comes forth with a vivid, leafy purity that suggests herbs, freshly turned earth and pure, lifted citrus. All we get right now are the flavors hovering above the core which is still firmly closed. A wealth of apple and citrus fruit is evoked which will awake with time, this is too young to be opened. Don't touch before 2018 and then drink until 2030 or even beyond. This is dry, delicate and yet powerful with a supremely clean finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The pure, delicate but ever so authentic scent of fragrant Muscat grapes rises from the glass. The palate is a joy: a feather-light, fragrant but intense experience of pure Muscat flavor. There is the textural tinge of lemon freshness and the uncompromising notion of stone on a dry, sprightly and utterly disarming palate of immense purity. What we are left with is a notion of fragrance and stone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Faint notes of ripe pear are only hinted at on the nose but on the dry palate they open up into pure, textured, precisely drawn fruit. There is concentration and a heady, seductive lemon and pear perfume hovering over the concentrated, profound palate of wet stone and immensely pure lemon oil. This comes on light, delicate feet but leaves you with a deep, lasting and impressive memory of Riesling purity and elegance.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very faint notes of mandarine and earth emanate from this delicate, closed wine. All the flavors are subdued and delicate with flinty smoke making an appearance here and there. All of this suggests that this is far too young to be approached: the structure, however, suggests delicacy and balance, tender flavors of linearity and precision. Smoke and salt characterize the long finish. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Everything about this stately Ribera heavyweight impresses. The nose is outright oaky, so expect derivative aromas of toast, clove, cinnamon and spice to go with black-fruit scents. This remains firm, tannic and tightly wrapped, with massive blackberry, chocolate and toast flavors. Peppery spice, brooding mixed-berry flavors and mouth-coating tannins endow a finish that signals that this has many good years ahead of it. Drink from 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932032.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lightly rusty in color, this outstanding gran reserva is just now entering its golden years, which should endure for another two decades or so. Aromas of raisin, malt, tobacco and cedar are beautiful. This is tight and sinewy in feel, with rooty, creamy, classic Rioja flavors of vanilla, tobacco and dried red fruits. A lasting, stout finish isn't breaking down at all; drink through 2040.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Like its big brother Alabaster, this is a superb Tinta de Toro that's powerfully built but also stylish. Aromas of cassis and blackberry are dark, malty and chocolaty. Flavors of burnt toast, dark chocolate, black peppercorn and blackberry end with a tannic yet balanced swirl of licorice and minerally complexity. Drink from 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A heady and lifted nose suggests healing herbs steeped in honey. The palate is rich and unctuous but fresh with the lemon peel, herb and clear honey notes that were already present on the nose. The balance between luscious and tart is on a knife's edge and all the more thrilling for it. The flavors last and last\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094not in sweetness but in utter, gloried freshness. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932040.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The purity of juicy, tart, red apples runs like a fault line through a very taut, linear, whistle-clean Riesling. This has purity and precision, linearity and drive. Still tightly wound, this needs time to unfold but promises to be a wine of great longevity and expression. Resolutely dry, the purity and concentration of flavors will always remain. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very enticing but ever so ethereal notes of tropical fruit are hinted at: yellow and pink grapefruit, passion fruit and even some pineapple. The palate is still in thrall to all the primary citrus notes but holds promise of stone and riper fruit. This is taut, elegant, concentrated, dry and whistle-clean. Like a superlative sports car waiting to be sped around a race track. This spells raciness, subtle power and linearity. What a super-clean finish. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is heady and fragrant, edged with dried chamomile and hay flowers and subdued honey. Underneath that is a notion of sweet, luscious apricot compote. With time, there are the most subtle notes of enticing pine resin and fir honey\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094lit and illuminated all the way by the purest and most concentrated of lemon acidity. A triumph of balance and richness.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: New leather, ripe woodland berry, aromatic herb and a balsamic whiff of menthol are some of the aromas you'll find on this full-bodied red.

On the firm linear palate, tight youthfully austere tannins support tart sour cherry, cranberry, anise and freshly ground clove. This still needs a few years to fully open and develop. Drink 2022\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932032.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah comes from adjacent blocks planted in 2002. It was aged in new French oak for 42 months, so the nose delivers rich aromas of sugar plum, gingerbread spice and black-cherry syrup. The palate is quite dry, with a dark-chocolate bitterness, woody juniper flavors and firm, structured tannins that give depth to the black-plum core and vanilla-pie-crust touch on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bottling's deeply layered nose shows black plum, blackberry, vanilla and licorice aromas. The impressive palate starts with rich baked-blueberry flavors before clove and dried ginger spices arrive to provide depth. The tannins are firm but not in the way.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is a unique blend of Grenache (63%), Syrah (19%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of raspberry, garigue, blueberry and herb give way to palate-coating red and blue-fruit flavors that persist on the finish. It shows a lovely sense of balance, poise and polish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe berry, exotic spice, menthol and underbrush slowly take shape in the glass.

The tannins are polished and soft, but provide a stiff-enough backbone to hold up black-currrant flavors that are enhanced with flashes of caramel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of pressed rose petal, underbrush, truffle, white pepper and leather. The already approachable palate delivers juicy black cherry, cooking spice and licorice. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very smooth and flavorful, this full-bodied wine pairs excellent concentration of dark-fruit flavors with subtle accents of both dark and milk chocolate. Classic varietal cues of black olive, black cherry and a faint hint of rosemary make it complex and interesting to taste. The mouthfeel strikes a good balance between firm, fine-grained tannins and a posh richness that helps the finish linger. Best after 2024.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is Terlato's ambitious entry into the cult Cabernet lottery. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, with Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc, it's an elaborate wine, deep and long in blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are impressive, yet young, giving a tough, astringent mouthfeel. But ageability is brought into question by some superripeness, in the form of raisins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sicily's Tasca family does a terrific job with this golden Chardonnay. The wine reflects the sunshine, warmth and generosity of the island. Aromas of stone fruit, vanilla, rose and almond blossom are followed by a beautifully creamy mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Delicious, first class and possibly ageable.

Made in the soft, appealing modern style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A founding father of Sicily's quality wine tradition, the 2006 Duca Enrico is a plush and rich red with bold berry flavors and a spicy vegetal touch of green curry leaf. An icon of southern Italian wine, the wine is well suited to roast beef or sophisticated meat dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy, velvety and spicy, this is lean and balanced in acidity with a meatiness to the midpalate and finish. Layered, it is concentrated in nuanced cherry and raspberry with a depth of forest floor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This small-production Cab is at first faint in subtle fruit but slowly works its magic, offering balanced layers of black currant and blackberry around soft, toasty mocha oak, picking up nuance and complexity on the way to a lingering finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A layered fragrance of blue flower, leather, tobacco, mature black fruit and incense lead the nose on this bold but refined wine. The palate doles out crushed blackberry, graphite and licorice alongside chewy tannins and surprisingly fresh acidity for an eight-year-old wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From a barrel selection of the Quintus block, planted to the 828 clone of Pinot Noir, this wine offers a bigger mouthfeel and heartier vinous experience, awash in darker cherry fruit and more substantial tannin. Floral in rose and violet on the nose, those floral highlights return on the palate, giving the wine a nice tension and balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense and feral in brooding dark cherry, this Terra Neuma from the extreme Sonoma Coast vineyard known as De Coelo is owned and tended to by the Benziger family, who pull out all the stops with its annual collection of Pinots from the site. Earthy, this one is also silky, subdued and quite elegant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cedar, char and blackberry aromas are full and ripe on the nose. Given the wine's age, its structure and tannic weight are just right. Earthy, lightly roasted flavors of spiced raspberry and plum finish peppery and dry. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lightly baked and charred on the nose, this is a well-oaked wine showing blackberry, cassis and lemon peel aromas. A saturated, layered palate features loamy blackberry and cassis flavors offset by peppery spice and cocoa dust. Licorice and blackened oak revive a sense of char on a broad, full finish. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very rich, concentrated and intense, almost jammy, showing the essence of ripe blackberry and cherry fruit nectar. Oak shows up as rich, smoky char. With firm tannins and a long, sweet, fruity finish, this Cabernet should age well. Too young and tight now, so give it until at least 2014.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very dry and tannic, an austere young Cabernet that offering much relief now. You'll find a very rich, concentrated core of blackberries and minerals, brightened by a scour of fine, clean acidity. The odds are heavily in favor of this wine aging well for a decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Clos du Val has always made wines with long-term cellaring in mind. This blend, based on Cabernet Sauvignon, is dry and tannic, with spicy, toasty oak dominating. Beneath that are rich, compelling notes of cassis and dark chocolate. The alcohol is refeshingly low, below 14%. This dramatic wine needs a minimum of six years, and should develop for at least ten.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black color shows a depth of extraction in this earthy, burly wine. It reveals layers of leather, cedar and tobacco most, with a billowy tannin structure providing a foundation for additional elements of meaty black fruit and graphite.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: If you're curious about how Priorat wines age, this 16-year-old blend of Garnacha and Carignan is a good indicator. Mature aromas of earthy grit, leather and spicy plum rest in front of a flush jammy palate with structure.

It's entirely exotic and delicious, both concentrated and lush.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This opulent wine is full of ripe fruit and has a generous texture.

But it opens in the glass, delighting in blackberry, cherry and a burst of clove, showing skill in winemaking from a blend of vineyards, some valley floor and others mountain.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a handsome percentage of whole-cluster fermentation in the mix, this wine shows a funky undercurrent of marshmallow and mushroom. It never quite finds its voice amid a light-bodied texture and disjointed body.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vigorous sparkler has flavors of red berry, bread crust, bitter walnut and a confectionary note. It's a bit on the lean side, with sharp vivacious bubbles that give it a bracing finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense and frisky, with mild green-herbal aromas standing out on the nose. Like any varietal Graciano, the wine is shrill, with acidity pushing the tart side of the huckleberry and blueberry fruit. Lean at the end, with little richness. Best for die-hard Rioja buffs and fans of acidic red wines.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cab is a big, rich wine, and while its power is considerable, it lacks subtlety.

Really beautiful to drink now, and should develop bottle complexities over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a huge wine, that's insanely rich and concentrated. It tastes like the ripest summer blackberries, still warm from the sun, mashed and drizzed with cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis and chocolate syrup. The estate vineyard is on Paso Robles' west side, and quite high in elevation in the southern spur of the Santa Lucia Mountains. The wine is ungainly now, and needs time to develop. Better after 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Though it's not mentioned on the label, the Malbec is sourced from the Pepper Bridge vineyard, and compares favorably with high end Argentine versions. Yummy and deep, its sweet berry flavors are matched to firm, polished tannins, and finished with a touch of pretty toast.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an elaborate wine that's dense, complex and immensely enjoyable. It has a fleshy, meaty quality, like a buttery veal piccata, alongside ripe white and yellow fruits. There's a firm, minerally quality, highlighted by crisp acidity, and the finish is bone dry.

One of the best examples of Roussanne out there.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made using grapes grown high in the Mayacamas Mountains, this is extremely concentrated in pineapple essence, peach custard and tropical fruit flavors. It's extravagant, with 50% new French oak playing a strong role in contributing notes of buttered toast, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9e and butterscotch to the flavor profile.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Gaja's classic Barbaresco is gorgeous in 2010, showing an intense perfume of violet, earth and ripe red fruits punctuated by balsamic notes.

Drink this after 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Expensive, yes, but defines the soft, luxurious modern style of extreme deliciousness. Made with a drop of Petit Verdot that seems to add depth, the wine is fantastically rich in blackberry, blueberry and cherry jam, chocolate and sweet oak. The tannins are a wonder, and there's just enough acidity to give a balanced tang. Will it age? Yes, but for how long is the question. Beautiful now and through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This rich, complex Cabernet feels dramatic in the mouth. It impacts immediately with black currant, cassis and oak flavors, yet is thoroughly dry, with firm, smooth tannins and an oily umami chewiness, like charred steak fat off the grill. The winemaker, Julien Fayard, previously was at Lafite Rothschild. He brings a Bordeaux-esque sensitivity to Napa's rich, ripe fruit. Hold until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard Barbaresco Riserva shows lovely floral and fruit scents of violet, iris, ripe berry and pressed powder.

This expression of Vino Nobile offers loads of dark fruit and spice backed by medium density and fresh acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smooth, sweet in fruit and easy to like. With its jammy flavors of blackberries and mocha, it's delicious, although it would benefit from greater complexity and not so much reliance on sheer intensity and oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by enormously ripe, powerful fruit flavors, this wine explodes with jammy blackberries, cherries and red plums. Oak adds even richer notes of toast and sweet caramel. Drink this deliciously soft wine now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak, toast, roasted coffee bean and wild berry aromas lead the nose.

This will last a long, long time; drink through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 57% S\\u00c3\\u00a9millon, the rest Sauvignon Blanc, this proprietary, estate wine is 100% barrel-fermented and built to age, a studious take on sultry oak and viscosity. Golden Delicious apple highlights the taste experience, reaching rich, concentrated proportion, before the wine finds its balance on the finish. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Equal parts Syrah and Merlot combine with 20% Cabernet Sauvignon in a big, concentrated package of generous fruit and tannin, bringing together fruit from both Napa and Sonoma counties. Full-bodied and grippy, blackberry and gamy meat are the stars of the show, with Cab's mix of dried herb and cedar coming through on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Caldwell Vineyard in Carneros, this 100% varietal, Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne-inspired wine is smoky, like a great outdoor barbecue, with dense elements of black pepper and gunpowder. Balanced, weighty and dense, it peaks in pomegranate, providing a tartness to the proceedings, particularly the finish. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Succulent and juicy in velvety waves of black-cherry cola, this is a delicious expression of Durell, with intriguing teases of truffle, black tea and forest floor. Concentrated and full bodied, it offers additional seasonings of cinnamon and black pepper, which persist through a long finish. Enjoyable now, this wine is structured to cellar through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full-bodied and loaded with finesse, this opens with aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, exotic spice, toast and a whiff of new oak.

This is a powerful specimen to drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The color is light but that's deceptive. Brooding aromas of coffee, smoke, peat, earth, mineral and fire pit lead to lightly styled but rich, focused savory flavors that display both deftness and intensity, with a sense of texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this offers lovely aromas of iris, fresh violet, perfumed berry and a whiff of sweet baking spice. The elegantly structured palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, mocha, white pepper and cinnamon while firm, velvety tannins offer support. It closes on a tobacco note.

With a lingering finish, it ends with a touch of dust. Cellar through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a relatively warm site within the burgeoning Petaluma Gap, this wine offers lush, velvety layers of blackberry, mint and dried herb, employing some whole-cluster fermentation to add to the weight and concentration. Perfumed in spice, it retains plenty of structure; it would be a good one to cellar, through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The winery's third vintage from this cooler-climate vineyard offers a mix of bright red cherry, wild, dried herb, rose and anise aromas rising to the fore. Lingering acidity keeps the firm tannins at bay\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the two opposites finding a peaceful balance, allowing a freshness of citrus to succulently creep in on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A somewhat basic undertaking of 82% Merlot with 9% Cabernet Franc and 9% Petit Verdot, this is herbal and giving in clove, tobacco and black plum.

Rich tannins provide much-needed balance. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine offers ripe yellow fruits and soft acidity. A honeyed character adds to the richness and generous character of this warm wine that is lightly cut by acidity at the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toast, roasted coffee bean and anisette aromas lift from the glass.

Yet everything about it is utterly and properly dry. The vineyard is in St. Helena, not quite in the Spring Mountain appellation, yet showing the fruit concentration firm tannins of mountain-grown grapes. Just a stupendous wine; try after 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is classic Three Palms Merlot\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094as excellent as anything Duckhorn has ever produced. It shows the hard tannins that always mark the winery's Bordeaux-style red wines, but it's luscious and deep in berry fruit, licorice, grilled meat and cola. It should have no difficulty negotiating the years. Give it until around 2015, but if you can't wait, at least decant it for a few hours.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: You will want to age this Cabernet\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00948 or 10 years of development is the only way to allow the hard tannins to begin to melt away, allowing the fabulous core of blackberries, currants and dark chocolate to emerge. It's hard to exaggerate the wine's depth; it's so elegantly pure, concentrated and focused. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018, and it could still be providing pleasure 20 years from now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing lovely silkiness, dryness and transparency, this is a Pinot to drink now or age for a while. The flavors are rich but elusive, suggesting wild summer raspberries, cola, pine needles and saut\\u00c3\\u00a9ed mushrooms splashed with balsamic, with the sweet smokiness of oak barrel aging. It's delicate and powerful, but only 47 cases were produced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bone dry, minerally and brisk in mouthwatering acidity, this has subtle yet rich flavors of tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey. It shows real elegance and complexity; drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in a rich, ripe style that perhaps favors power over elegance, this is delicious from start to finish. It's a big, intense wine, massive in blackberry and mocha flavors, with a bacon meatiness that's part Syrah, part smoky oak. While it's a little obvious in its appeals, it does show Syrah at its flashy Napa best.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Biondi-Santi performs exceptionally well in elegant vintages like 2006. This wine is balanced and fresh, with lingering notes of wild berry, white cherry, cola, spice and dark chocolate.

The actual fruit flavor is incredibly rich and concentrated in blackberries, black currants and crisp bacon. The impression is of a sweet, delicious Cabernet that's a touch warm in alcohol, but lush and refined.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This starts out closed and tight, shut down by tannins and immaturity, but plenty of swirling reveals elusive black-licorice and blackberry notes, accented by smoky oak. The tannins really kick in toward the middle, but hard as they are, they exhibit great breed. Despite its sweet core of fruit, this is nowhere close to being ready. Give it 10 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Very rich, ripe and dramatically textured, this has explosive flavors of blackberry, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis, dried herb and smoked meat flavors, enriched by smoky oak. It shows the tough, hard tannins you often find in low production mountain Cabernets. Made by the well-known consulting winemaker, Philippe Melka, it has the structure of a wine that needs age. Give it at least eight years, and it could be one that lasts decades.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: So rich and seemingly sweet in black currant, chocolate fudge and toasted oak flavors, you can hardly keep from drinking the whole bottle now. But that would be a mistake. You don't want to age it so long that all the fruit drops out, but 8\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years in the cellar should do just fine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tilled earth, ripe dark-skinned berry, leather and menthol aromas show this wine's Sangiovese pedigree. The robust, concentrated palate doles out crushed black cherry, raspberry jam, cinnamon, licorice and the warmth of evident alcohol\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the latter a common characteristic of this hot vintage. Firm, ripe tannins provide the framework.

Made in an opulent, full-bodied style, it'll pair well with buttery fare.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas that come together are those of scorched earth, grilled porcini, roasted coffee bean and a bit of burnt rubber. The mature palate offers dried cherry, blackberry confiture, mocha, vanilla and a hint of game alongside tongue-drying tannins that clench the finish. Give this a few years to unfold then drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A 100% varietal wine made by Kirk Venge, this tiny-production offering is concentrated in leather and dark baked fruit.

A saline note signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is fruity and crisp. It is also full of ripe apple and rich pear fruits that give density and fine concentration to this delicious impressive wine. The acidity adds brightness while the minerality comes from the taut steely texture.

Taut and savory, it offers crunchy red berry, star anise, ground clove and a hint of tobacco on the palate. Youthfully assertive, fine-grained tannins and vibrant acidity lend structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of seven grapes (Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Sangiovese, Petit Verdot and Alicante), this elegantly structured wine opens with aromas of toast, coffee, black pepper and dark-skinned fruit.

The firm, savory palate offers ripe plum, juicy black cherry, cinnamon, clove and dark chocolate alongside velvety tannins.

It has a core of ripe black fruit that will round out as it develops. Solid, chunky, firm and dense.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet starts out tight and resistant. Although it has plenty of ripe cherry and blackberry fruit, there's something pinched about the mouthfeel. It's a good wine that will benefit from airing, but doesn't seem likely to improve in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Superripe, showing a direct, crowd-pleasing appeal with its array of oak-inspired blackberries, cherries, sweet currants and chocolate. The structure is gorgeous Napa, with near-perfect tannins and just-in-time acidity. Shows a juvenile fruity sweetness, but is not particularly subtle now, just all power. The gamble is in the cellar. Try after 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Syrah and Petite Sirah is made in a drink-me-now style that emphasizes sheer deliciousness. Soft and almost sweet, it dazzles with pastry-filling cherries and raspberries, with exotic touches of cocoa, anise and cinnamon. Tannins provide a sturdy architecture, but they're ripe and accessible.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its high percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon (60%), this gives an initial serious structure, topped with rich, ripe black fruit flavors. The tannins are calmed by this richness, with spice, blueberries and blackberry juice much more dominant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Scorched earth, grilled herb, toast and ripe berry aromas lift out of the glass. On the dense, full-bodied palate, notes of cinnamon, clove and licorice add depth the black cherry core. Firm, velvety tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and dense, this concentrated wine has a fine, smooth texture that is ripe with red-berry fruits. The freshness of the vintage comes through in the acidity and crisp, taut texture. The wine will be ready to drink from 2020, the 800th anniversary of the oldest-known traces of this vineyard.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured wine is firm at this early stage, with tannins and a touch of bitter-chocolate extraction that needs to diminish before the black fruits get their chance. Keep this dark, solid wine until 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe wine.

Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intensely fragrant, this opens with scents of violet, rose, perfumed berry and a subtle whiff of menthol.

Warm temperatures and a long growing season have surely played an important part in developing the aromas of black fruit, sweet spice, plum and dried prune that come forward. The wine shows elegance and integration with a firm, unyielding tannic structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subdued aromas suggesting stewed plum, mature berry, dried herb and scorched earth lead the nose. The straightforward, rather evolved palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, leather, clove and a green note of powdered sage alongside tightly wound tannins that clench the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy aromas of game, porcini mushroom, scorched earth, saline and crushed herb meld together on this.

This is Macabeo, Garnacha Blanca and Pedro Xim\\u00c3\\u00a9nez.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red berry, tilled earth, menthol and dark cooking spice unfold in the glass.

Yet crispness, a core of tight structure, toast and fresh fruits are always present. The play between the characters is delicious and likely to allow the wine to age over several years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A masterpiece it may be, but right now, in its precocious youth, it's all jammy fruit and smoky oak. But what jam! What oak! Tastes rich and compellingly good, like being swept away on a tidal wave of blackberry essence and cocoa. Very good, very rich, very fine, but you want to stash it away for a few years to let the parts meld.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A tannins-dominated wine, firm and dry.

The luminous, racy palate offers sour cherry, crushed raspberry, star anise and energizing mineral framed in firm, refined tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is half Funk Estate Vineyard Syrah, with the rest McClellan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The two varieties somewhat seem to cancel each other out initially, with aromas of smoked meat, cherry, herb and earth that don't seem fully resolved.

There's plenty of interest, but it doesn't all entirely come together at present.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 100% Cab, this wine is boldly fruity with flavors of black cherries and currants, along with toasted, caramelized marshmallows. The tannins are refined and there's good acidity for balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This purple-tinted Carignan is a concentrated number with familiar varietal and regional aromas of latex, graphite, schist, tire rubber and black fruits.

Apple and lemon notes linger and leave the palate utterly clean.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made with 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this opens with aromas of ripe black currant, cedar and white pepper.

The wood elements already show integration and will continue to diminish with time. Give this wine five or so more years of cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark smoky, stout aromas of licorice, molasses and blackberry feed into a jammy palate with rock-hard, clamping tannins.

Cheek-sucking tannins make for a rugged mouthfeel. Spicy, peppery berry flavors are fully oaked and toasty, while this tastes dry and minty on the finish.

It's compact and powerful, but not over the top.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This spent two years maturing in large oak casks and one year in barriques. Such an aging regimen has imparted deep aromas of spice, tobacco, toasted almond, chocolate and tobacco that surround lively notes of blackberry and ripe cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a firm wine with great fruit density, with a round, generous and velvety texture. It has a touch of wood that needs to integrate with the flavor of red plum skin. The dark tannins create a wine that will age for several years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from grapes sourced from Domaines Devillard's 12 acres of premier cru Mercurey vineyards, this rich, weighty wine has ripe red fruits that are layered with new wood and tannins. A structured effort that's meant to age for five years and more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a strong, dry and tannic Cabernet Sauvignon, with intense blackberry, black currant and new oak flavors. Right now, it's immature, offering little beyond sheer power. Will it age? Six years is no problem. After that, the overripeness, in the form of raisins, may easily kick in.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An initially wood-laden wine that only slowly reveals the rich fruit character. There is wood certainly, but the spice integrates well with the green fruits and the intense minerality. The great steely backbone on this wine indicates it will age.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Erickson is the winemaker at Screaming Eagle, and he participated in this charitable project for Lookout Ridge.

There's an enormous concentration of black currants and minerals, but the wine is immature in astringent tannins. Needs time, and possibly lots of it. Best 2011 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the most popular Chablis premier crus, and this soft wine shows why. It hints at minerality, but the main flavors are a great burst of apple and citrus. It has just the right vivid green character, the vanilla from the wood a very subtle afterthought.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is solid, concentrated and tannic, and it has a dark chocolate flavor from having aged in wood. It's likely to develop into a chunky wine over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's no mistaking that this wine comes from The Rocks District, with its perfumed aromas of grilled asparagus, peat, dried herb and minerally, earthy funk.

Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A brilliantly complex but rarely done blend, this mix of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon and 42% Petite Sirah shows blueberry donuts, vanilla ice cream, licorice, stewed strawberries and the lightest touch of dill and herbal aromatics on the nose. Gravel, asphalt and elderberry come through on the sip, elevated by white and black pepper. It's still a tad wound up.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This highly concentrated, black-as-night RDD is inky, volatile and cheesy smelling, but also loaded with massive black-fruit scents. Saturated to the max, this is tannic as nails. Huge blackberry, chocolate and fig flavors end with prodding, rock-hard tannins and flavors of blackened toast, chocolate and cassis extract.

The chewy palate boasts raspberry confiture, red cherry, espresso, dark chocolate, orange peel and tobacco while tightly knit, fine-grained tannins provide the framework. A licorice note closes the lingering finish. It's youthfully assertive and needs to fully develop. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo has an intense fragrance of rose petal, berry, incense and spice. The palate is still a bit closed and very youthful, revealing black cherry, herbs and aggressive tannins. This needs more time to develop complexity and soften up. Drink after 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows ripe cherry aromas and hints of roasted coffee bean and underbrush. The palate is still a bit closed, but offers ripe cherry flavors, hints of orange peel, anisette and a coffee note. This is still young and tightly tannic, but should evolve nicely.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of those old-fashioned field blends of Zinfandel, Petite Sirah, Carignane and who knows what else. It's super-fruity, with waves of blackberries, cherries and all kinds of other berries accented with milk chocolate, anise and cedar. Finishes a bit sweet and tannic. Drink now, with barbecue.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With easily enjoyed flavors of cherries, raspberries and cola, and a nice coat of sweetly smoked sandalwood, this is a pleasant Pinot Noir to drink now. The light body, and some sharpness on the finish, argue against ageability.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A new-style wine, ultraripe in blackberry and cherry jam, and heavily oaked, showing lush layers of caramel and smoky butterscotch. Obvious and almost over the top now in flash and flamboyance. Might pull together in a couple years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: For this classic, restrained Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot, the grapes were grown in Rutherford, Yountville and St. Helena. The wine is juicy in soft red cherry and cassis. Seamless on the palate, it offers a nice progression from explosive fruit to measured acidity and low oak, the finish balanced between all three.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A Cab lover's Merlot, this wine is massively constructed, a behemoth of tobacco-laced blue fruit and smoke, nearing pie-like proportion. With time and/or a decant, it'll reveal pretty violet on the nose, and take on a sultry juiciness to overcome its weight. Lay this baby down through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: High acidity marks this vibrant wine, which is from one of Kendall-Jackson's coolest coastal vineyards. The crispness lends a vibrant tension to the intense flavors of Meyer lemons, orange blossom and minerals, while oak adds softer, spicy notes. Feels racy and nervy all through, in a delicious way.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is the densest, most tannic of Pride's new releases, obviously meant for the cellar. You could drink it now, because it's so lush, but the tightness suggests that the winemaker doesn't want you to. Buried under the astringency are masses of cassis, dark chocolate, sweet fresh herbs and smoky oak. Better after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne blend from the fashionable west side of Paso Robles is made in the modern cult style.

Not exactly your classically dry table wine. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's no Merlot in California that's richer or more decadent than this. The flavors of cherry pie filling, cassis, red currants, chocolate, licorice and smoky oak are totally delicious. Granted, the wine is a little soft, with a melted texture, and classicists will complain it's made in the International style. They're missing out on a real hedonistic pleasure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is rich, but the balance of the wine is excellent, the wood very much underneath the smooth, opulent apricot and pear fruits. There is spice, which adds a fine piquancy to the texture. The finish is vivid, still young, needing at least five years to age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of various vineyards from the far or \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009ctrue\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d Sonoma Coast, and also Hartford Court's highest-production Pinot Noir. Always beautiful and balanced, the '07 in particular is remarkable for its silky tannins and overall seamless quality. Really excites for the complexity of currant, cola, licorice and cedar flavors. Now through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in the Pride style, this is a big, powerful wine that should age well. It's enormously ripe, with flamboyant cassis, cherry pie filling, milk chocolate, licorice and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into thoroughly modern, softly refined tannins. Just beautiful, and should develop through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is still a bit closed but eventually reveals aromas of dark berry, leafy underbrush, baked earth and tobacco. On the firm palate, notes of licorice, grilled herbs and black pepper add depth to the black cherry core.

The firm palate delivers red cherry, raspberry, mocha, tobacco and licorice accompanied by bracing tannins and fresh acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, thick and velvety, this has a wealth of heightened acidity to buoy the more intense aspects.

The densely packed palate offers mature blackberry, black cherry, cracked peppercorn and dried herbs alongside a backbone of chewy tannins. A nutty note signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A combination of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 20% Petit Verdot and a dollop of other grapes, this concentrated wine offers aromas of dark berry, cedar, espresso and kitchen spice.

From there, this gigantic, mind-stopping wine is mouth-filling in vanilla, blackberry, oak and chocolate. You'll need a cigarette after you're done.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Duckhorn's new releases are so good, you might hesitate to make the investment on this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend. True, it's not the most drinkable of their wines, at this time, but it easily is the most intense and concentrated. Dazzles with a molten core of sweet blackberries, blueberries and cassis, deep and long in the finish. Don't insult it by drinking before 2013, but you're better served by holding for far longer, even into the 2020s.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A landmark wine for the Valpolicella region, Vigneto di Monte Lodoletta is surely among the biggest, boldest and most concentrated red wines on the planet. Thanks to the appassimento process, extremely low yields and long oak aging, this Amarone takes intensity and richness to new extremes. The tannins are still astringent and tight, and the wine will absolutely not ready be to drink any less than a decade from now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hints of smokiness combine with a perfumed character in this wonderful wine. It has richness, with lychee and spice flavors, while adding the extra complexity of a touch of toast and green tea. Wonderful now, but will age for five years and more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This ultrarich, opulent wine has such purity of fruit.

The wine is redolent of black fruit, jammy blackberry, plum cake, bitter chocolate and polished granite. There's a pretty, linear and clean quality behind all that bold fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Amarone Bosan is a terrifically impressive wine with beautiful tones of polished river stone, savory spice, plum cake, root beer and liquid smoke. Sweet cherry and blackberry flavors are folded within the wine's rich texture and dense concentration. You'll love it.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A compelling wine. Made from this Bordeaux blending variety seldom seen bottled on its own, the grapes were grown in the Stagecoach Vineyard, high up on Atlas Peak, increasingly a source of some of Napa's greatest red wines.

Hard to tell where it's going, but delicious now. Decant for an hour or two before serving.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a restrained and structured wine, light in tart cranberry, rhubarb and an overwhelming attraction of baked plum. Lush and plush on the palate without ever pushing too far, it lingers in cardamom.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from 40-year-old vines on a 15-acre vineyard, the wine is almost entirely Merlot.

Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the first release from this particular vineyard for the Syrah-focused winery. Its aromas, which pop with notes of strawberry and spice, have both herbal and copper-penny undertones. The fruit and savory flavors play well off of each other, showing a sense of elegance and deftness, with a touch of new wood that contributes to the flavor and feel. The finish stretches out. It still drinks quite young and if the aromas meld together could move up a notch or two.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Solidly in the Saxum style, which is to say a high alcohol (15.5%), massively flavored wine of enormous concentration and power. The blackberry, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors have all kind of overtones, ranging from licorice and vanilla to gingerbread and candied violets. Saxum has become a cult favorite, one of the highest-priced brands from Paso Robles, and wines like this are the reason why. Drink now and through 2008. Syrah, Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre and Grenache.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine comes from a particular portion of the estate vineyard, and is almost entirely Syrah, with a splash of Grenache. It is a brilliant wine, entirely New World, and impressive even by California and Australia standards. Massively rich in cherry, chocolate, cassis, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors, the '05 Bone Rock is softly tannic and compulsively drinkable, although the alcohol, 16.1%, is considerable. Best now and for a year or two.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in large quantities from estate vineyards as well as one sourced site in Rutherford, this wine shows a richness of red fruit and a kick of heat around prominent notes of oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's all about ripe, flashy flavor in this softly elegant wine. It offers immediately likeable blackberry, cherry, currant, licorice, oak and spice notes, wrapped into firm but gentle tannins.

It's almost assaultive in blackberries and black currants that are sweet and jammy, while oak adds even sweeter notes of caramel and butterscotch.

Try after 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A broad, spicy wine, ripe with plenty of sweet mango and peach fruits to go with the green fruit acidity.

Powerfully, lavishly oaky, with a ripe, chewy black-fruit flavor, it is bursting with notes of black cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and a hint of butter. Though not quite as graceful or detailed as the regular Cabernet, this is the more potently expressive of the two flagship Leonetti reds.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very rich wine that's made in the modern style of soft ripeness and upfront deliciousness.

It's almost ready to drink but will be better from 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This was the first vineyard bought by the Bouchard family, purchased in 1791.

Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper. There's a slight bit of alcoholic burn on the finish, but it doesn't drink as hot as you'd guess.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a compelling wine with aromas of coffee, dried herbs, cherry and barrel spices. It wins over on finesse rather than power but shows more than ample amounts of both. There's enough structure that it will benefit from some time in the cellar. It will be best from 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This sophisticated wood-aged wine comes from a fine year for whites in Pessac-L\\u00c3\\u00a9ognan.

At the beginning, it seems very soft, but then it is possible to discern rich tannins through the concentrated red fruits and black plums. The acidity is there all the time, a fine counterpoint to the seductive, rich fruits and dry tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine.

Crushed stone minerality lingers on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoky char, dried herb, cedar and cherry with plum adorn this full-figured concentrated wine, which shows a touch of heat on the palate.

Two years in new French oak give it a youthful, tannic nature around smoky black cherry, burly leather and full-bodied richness and concentration. Further time in the bottle should coax out the blackberry and cherry; cellar through 2027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This gorgeously crafted, full-bodied Tempranillo is a modern beauty.

There's a good core of black currants that might emerge after a long time in the cellar. Perhapstash it away until 2024 and see what happens.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Onion-skin pink in color, this wood-aged wine is opulent and ripe. It is textured, with generous red fruits that are given a great lift by the spice and pepper that fill the mouth and give the wine power and richness. The acidity is well integrated, finishing the wine with freshness. A far cry from so many fruity ros\\u00c3\\u00a9s, this is a serious wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fermented with 80% whole clusters and aged 18 months in neutral French oak, this outright delicious wine offers aromas of black and green olive, mineral, moist earth and dried herbs. It's seamless in feel, delivering lithe, pillowy soft fruit, savory flavors and a hyperextended finish. It's a testament to the strength of Syrah from this region.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of blue flower, spiced plum, ripe berry and leather take shape in the glass. The delicious palate delivers layers of crushed black cherry, licorice, clove and grilled herb alongside polished tannins and fresh acidity. It's both structured and elegant. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made from 60-year-old vines from a property next door to Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e, this wine is both structured and rich. It has dark tannins, with juicy and jammy plum fruits that are layered with acidity. It is still firm, dense and needs time. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Marconnets vineyard on the slopes above Savigny-l\\u00c3\\u00a8s-Beaune produces some of the most perfumed wines in the appellation. This is typical, a wonderful medley of juicy, fruity aromas. It is still young, although temptingly attractive now. Drink ideally from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This beautifully perfumed wine has rounded tannins finely integrated into the opulent red cherry fruit. It's already a delicious wine, juicy and fragrant, although still with a long future. If you can wait, drink it from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Closed up and just hinting at its great potential, this wine is showing tannins and a dry, solid core. Slowly it reveals delicious, opulent red berry fruits and concentrated texture. It needs a lot of time before drinking; wait until 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its wonderful poise between dark structure and intensely fragrant fruit, this is firm, dry and packed with ripe blackberry fruits. It has great potential, as befits a concentrated wine from Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e, and is certainly not ready to drink before 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is as serious as Provence ros\\u00c3\\u00a9 can get. It is a limited production wine, selected from the best Grenache (75%) and Syrah (25%) parcels. Structured and impressively dense, its red fruits are concentrated, bone-dry and with a textured character. It is ready to drink although it will become richer from early 2016. The Sumeire family arrived in the Sainte Victoire mountain range in the 13th century.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of Bordeaux grapes sourced from the Riparbella Vineyard, which is located at 1,500 feet above sea level in Maremma. The property belongs to the Ferragamo fashion family. The tannins are velvety, firm and do a great job of supporting the bright flavors of black fruit and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll love the way this wine builds in intensity on the nose and on the palate. The blend is Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, and together the varieties deliver bright berry flavors and firm structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, bold and cuddly, this wine's tannins are cushioned by the red berry fruit and attractive acidity. It has weight and a rich feeling, and the dry edge offers the possibility of aging. This small clos is exclusive to Jaffelin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a closed, smoke-filled wine, and its tannins and toasty wood character currently dominate, which gives it a bitter edge. It has richness, with hints of juicy fruit that sit under the structure. Give it at least six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense, generous aromas of white flower, passion fruit, citrus blossom and crushed stone comprise the nose. This blend of Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay offers impressive intensity and a long, spicy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Elisabetta Geppetti is a beautiful and dynamic woman, with a firm grasp on Sangiovese and Scansano. Her riserva offers ripe fruit, wonderful softness and hints of wild brush and scrub oak in the background.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This blend opens with ripe aromas that recall blueberry and strawberry jam, followed by notes of spice, chocolate and moist tobacco. The finish is soft and velvety, and it comes with a touch of plush richness. This is complex and balanced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This dry, complex Cabernet Sauvignon bears classic Napa tannins, plus layers of blackberry, black currant, violet, mineral and cedar flavors. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville area. Drink now, after decanting, and continue to drink it through 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the most successful Syrah-Cabernet Franc blends in California. The Syrah brings blueberry and bacon flavors, and the Cabernet provides the black currant note and the tannic backbone. It's already delicious to drink, but allow it to breathe in a decanter for one or two hours.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rich, rounded wine, yet it also expresses a tight texture and nervy acidity. The toast influence is still dominating, although the fruitiness of this ripe selection is also showing. With its weight and structure, this is a prime candidate to age for several years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Packed with red fruits, this wine has great potential, with attractive wild-strawberry fruits that are fresh and perfumed. Behind this fruitiness, the wine is tight and structured. It will be round, rich and ready to drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A normal five-barrel production was cut to two because of hail. This wine is firm, with hints of the generosity of the appellation waiting behind the dry texture. It's structured, with acidity and plum skins that will take some time. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle aromas of leafy underbrush, leather, truffle and red berry come together on this while the full-bodied palate delivers juicy red cherry, raspberry compote, baking spice and grilled herb. Chewy tannins provide the framework while a note of star anise closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a juicy wine, packed with red fruits. It has acidity along with an edge of tannins. The attractive fruitiness suggests the wine will develop quickly. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, licorice, ripe black plum, menthol and toasted hazelnut emerge on this. The structured but already accessible palate offers ripe black cherry, fleshy raspberry, vanilla, clove and a note of pipe tobacco alongside a backbone of firm, close-grained tannins. Drink from 2017 through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Old vines planted in a small parcel at the base of the Corton hill give this ripe and rich wine. Full of jammy fruit, it has structure as well as strawberry and red-cherry flavors, packed with juiciness that comes from the acidity. This wine has a good future. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Woodland berry, forest floor, blue flower, tobacco and a hint of leather come together in the glass. The chewy, accessible palate offers juicy wild cherry, fleshy raspberry, cake spice and star anise accompanied by velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing scents of violet, rose, leather and truffle take shape in the glass. The elegant, approachable palate offers toast, ripe raspberry and white pepper alongside firm, refined tannins. It closes on a note of star anise. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Fragrant blue flower, menthol and a hint of exotic spice aromas come together on this firmly structured wine. The elegant palate still needs to fully open up but already reveals ripe Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, white pepper and a hint of orange peel alongside firm, polished tannins. Drink after 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine has both structure and ripe red-plum fruits. It is dark and dense, solid and with good acidity. A clear line of freshness promises a good future. This needs time, so don't drink before 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light, clear and varietal, this wine is pungent in earth, chocolate, black tea and leather, medium- to full-bodied with remarkable offerings of sage, rosemary and savory mushroom. Cherry and cinnamon add to the intrigue and flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This family domaine has produced a rich, structured wine from its holding in Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e. It is firm, dark and concentrated with rich tannins and red-berry fruit. Spice, acidity and a dense aftertaste promise aging. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense blackberry and black-cherry aromas come with notes of licorice, espresso and barnyard. Huge across the palate, this starts out lush but quickly transitions to hard as rocks and tannic as nails. Toasty, blackened flavors of pepper, blackberry, cassis and chocolate finish spicy and chocolaty, with fierce, clamping tannins. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Within an enclave of adored cool-climate vineyard sites, just under five miles from the ocean, Taylor Ridge is planted to the Swan clone of Pinot Noir. In this bottling, the culmination of site and Swan comes together in complex, savory ways. Burnt orange meets blackberry tart in a brooding, tightly gripped wine that manages to hold on to a thicket of acidity, giving it balance and brightness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, ripe dark-skinned berry, violet, leather and aromatic herb lead the nose. The ripe, full-bodied palate doles out black cherry, cranberry, licorice, espresso and a sprinkling of mocha alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Purple flowers, black cherries, licorice, black sesame, beef char and a touch of tar show on the nose of this bottling by David Parrish and family. The palate combines clean flavors of milk chocolate and espresso bean with tart boysenberry and more of a tarry tension.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Gavin Chanin's co-effort with Durell owner Bill Price aims to show vibrancy and freshness of fruit and succeeds on both counts in this light-bodied, complex wine. Clove, rich, dark cherry and bright acidity combine for a fresh take on a typically voluptuous vineyard, finding the layers of rocky minerality that lie beneath.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This blend of the 1996, '98 and '02 vintages is mature and browning in hue. The nose is superripe, with prune, brandied cherry, tobacco and molasses notes. A soft, creamy palate holds vanilla, tobacco, baking spice, prune and raisin flavors, while the finish is an echo of what came before. Excellent when judged in its own right, this doesn't quite compare with Vega's best wines. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sangue d'Oro is a hearty, extracted Passito dessert wine made with fragrant Zibibbo grapes. The wine is thick and dense and beautifully redolent of chestnut honey, candied fruit and almond paste.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Merlot, this offers juicy blackberry and black cherry flavors, with a tart underbelly of acidity. Firm tannins and oak notes support the rounded, brightly fresh fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The majority of grapes within this red are grown in Yountville and certified organic. Simple aromatics make way for a touch of reduction on the nose, while flavors of brushy sage, cedar and clove offer more spice than fruit. Sharp tannins lie beneath.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with 7% Petit Verdot and 7% Petite Sirah, this velvety and dense wine conveys a pronounced element of charred oak. A reduced note from the barrel permeates at first before allowing aromas and flavors of baked plum to show.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: So ripe and lush with fruit, this could only be from California. It assaults the palate with blackberries, cherries and mocha, but with an interesting, earthy green olive note. Oak adds predictable but rich notes of buttered toast. The tannins are soft enough for you to drink this lovely wine now, but you can age it for 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years if you want.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This delicious Amarone has both structure and finesse. It offers a fragrance of pressed iris petals along with dark, ripe fruit and spice. The silky smooth palate delivers black cherry layered with cocoa, nutmeg and black pepper along with a hint of dried fig.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The vineyard isn't well known, but it's on Pritchard Hill, near much more famous sources of Cabernet. It's a deceptive wine, so rich and flamboyant in sweet, jammy blackberries and cherries, chocolate and licorice, you want to drink the whole bottle. Yet it has the tannin-acid balance to age, possibly for a long time. Made from 100% Cab, yet produced in tiny quantities, it shows the Pritchard signature of youthful deliciousness combined with ageability.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A gorgeous wine, showing a deft hand of restraint despite evident power. Yes, the alcohol is high and heady, but the wine wears it well, so that heat is only a part of a spectrum of impressions that include refined tannins and rich layers of blackberries, blueberries, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis liqueur and toast. The finish is dry and elegant. No need to age this beauty, so drink up.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Juicy, dusty and wrapped in cedar, this rarefied wine is classic in nature, with highlights of pencil shavings, red currant and a dose of dried cherry. The oak is robust and supportive, offering specks of vanilla and clove, the tannins thick and tenacious, ready to mellow in time. Drink best from 2023 through 2033.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Produced from vines high up the Grand Cru slope, this wine is finely textured and stylish while also full-bodied. It has weight, spice from wood aging, precise acidity and a strongly mineral, salty edge. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright and refreshing acidity is the star of this lovely, windswept wine, powerful yet integrated in tannin and oak. The racy, feral notes of anise, apple blossom and nutmeg are complemented by a teasingly voluptuous spirit that never overwhelms.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the rocky, volcanic soils of Durell, this white is exuberant in salty rock and sea spray, showing plenty of influence from the Pacific Ocean to its west. Sturdy in structure and length, the fruit is twisted in pink grapefruit and crisp apple, its underbelly a richer, warmer expression of toffee and caramel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nothing small about this Pinot Noir. It's almost as good as the 2007, which was terrific. Dry and elegant, it shows massively concentrated cherry, raspberry and cola flavors, with a rich coating of smoky sandalwood. Wonderful now, but the youthful power suggests time in the cellar through 2015 or so.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine's appearance perfectly fits what you dream of in Brunello Riserva, and so do its aromas. It opens with dark ruby concentration and intense aromas of black cherry, currants, wet earth and smoked bacon. In the mouth, this gorgeous wine is soft, supple and long lasting. Drink now or hold five more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Really nice and lush, with an aromatic mix of tobacco, baked fruit, mocha, vanilla, shoe polish, earth and more. It displays a ripe, friendly feel and yummy flavors of mocha, chocolate and savory, subtle berry fruits. Layered on the finish, with lasting notes of fig, mocha and blackberry. Drink now through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A pure and intense rendition of Priorato. The nose is stacked with minerality, smoke, ink and tough but regal black fruit aromas. It's powerful and concentrated in the mouth, with bold cassis and blackberry flavors in front of a long, flavorful, slightly lemony finish. Needs a few years to show its best; drink from 2011 through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% varietal wine is both lean and dusty with a grip of firm, dry tannin. Chocolate, tar, cedar and pencil combine for a profile that's both rich and classically savory.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A full-bodied, quite ripe expression of the variety with an abundance of baked apple offset by a zest of lime, this wine is rich in vanilla and marshmallow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the 2003 vintage, this sweet red wine shows well evolved aromas of candied fruit, prune, black raisin, exotic spice and barbecue wood. The wine sports tight, gritty tannins and soft, jammy sweetness on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A mix of earthy berry, cassis and leather aromas sets up a grabby, rubbery palate that isn't very lush or cushioned. Flavors of roast plum, savory spice, olive and tobacco are more earthy than ripe, staying steady on a savory, roasted-tasting finish. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Richly oaked aromas of maple and mocha accent earthy, rubbery berry scents. This is muscled-up and edgy on the palate, with flavors of tobacco, mocha, plum and berry fruits. A grabby, slightly collapsed finish contains earthy, savory flavor remnants. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the mighty site, this is aged in both French and American oak, half of it new. Rich, robust layers of Dr Pepper, vanilla and chocolate rise on the smoothly textured palate, impressing in power and density.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine comes from a tiny seven-acre estate to the east of the town of Saint-Emilion. Owned by the same family since 1847, it estate is making serious wine. This is a rich wine, perfumed by Cabernet Franc although firmly based in Merlot. Black plum and berries are strengthened by the firm tannins that will allow further aging. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This first vintage of Coevo (a super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot) represents a new and dynamic project for Tuscany's historic Cecchi estate. The wine is rich, opulent and redolent of all kinds of dark fruit and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With a deep, shiny color of copper and peach blush, you can tell this sparkling wine will be somewhat full-bodied and rich. And it is. Made from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, it's a big, flamboyant bubbly, rich in raspberries, limes and yeast. Yet it retains the delicacy and elegance of a fine sparkling wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a 300-acre property in Castellina in Chianti, Trasolo (100% Merlot) is a top-shelf wine with rich opulence and sophistication. Deep layers of cherry, blackberry, spice and leather are folded tight together and the wine is smooth and enduring on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Extra-ordinarily sweet, with fantastic honey, apricot, pineapple, orange marmalade, buttered toast and vanilla cream flavors. What's not to like? Could be more complex, but dazzles for sheer decadence.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful wine from a classic vintage, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon offers harmony, intensity and elegance. Berry and dark fruit aromas are enhanced by smooth texture, fine tannins and balanced acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A soft wine that hints at the richness of Meursault, with caramel flavors giving weight, and a distinct citrus and apple character giving freshness. For early drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, truffle and eucalyptus aromas take the lead. The full-bodied, no-frills palate shows spiced cranberry, dried cherry, sage and a hint of cinnamon while assertive, close-grained tannins provide robust support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, white chocolate, clove and dried sage aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of espresso. The medium-bodied palate doles out red raspberry, cranberry and coffee bean while firm tannins lead to a tight, astringent close. Drink 2021\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932033.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, it has aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled earth, toasted oak sweet vanilla and a hint of leather. The rich palate offers toasted oak, black berries, espresso and coffee alongside dusty, drying tannins\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The blackberry, black currant, cassis and licorice flavors on this wine are strong, ripe and complex, and a rich coating of oak brings toast and vanilla notes. But the wine, which is a blend based on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, is so tannic that it's hard to appreciate now. Give it until 2019 to come around.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the winery's luxury-level releases, this doesn't play the massive Paso ripeness game, instead offering easy notes of black currant, violet, grape candy and burnt caramel on the nose. The palate is even more restrained, with black cherries, baking spice, a touch of asphalt and soft tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A coming together of nearly equal parts Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller additions of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot, this shows a confectionary streak of cherry-vanilla, its fruitiness offset by dry, dense tannins and cedar-tinged oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is soft and rounded with attractive red-cherry fruits, ripe strawberries and touches of wood and tannin. Acidity comes along behind this richness. It is going to develop quickly and will give great pleasure. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firmly touched by wood, this is a rich and also structured wine. It has spice as much as fruit at this stage, the juicy acidity lurking behind the toasty exterior. The wine should balance out but will need time. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine leads off with aromas of mint, spearmint, espresso, oak and red berries. The palate shows cherry, coffee, cooking spices and espresso alongside drying wood tannins. It lacks the fruit richness and structure that one expects from Brunello.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is rather inexpressive and already evolved. The nose reveals red and black berries accented with notes of black pepper that carry over to the palate. It's one dimensional and tightly tannic.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stewed black fruit, prune, raisin, espresso and exotic spice aromas lead the nose on this blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc. The densely concentrated palate is dominated by toasted oak, grilled bell peppers and notes of black plum, all sweetened up with coffee, dark chocolate and sugary vanilla extract. It closes on a note of bitter wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this dense wine features aromas of black plum, bell pepper, cedar, mocha and toasted oak. The palate is driven by very evident oak, chocolate, vanilla and concentrated, almost sugary, blackberry. The sweetness is broken up by an astringent, drying note of wood tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a Merlot you might want to lay down for a while. On release, it's dry and tannic, with primary fruit cherry and red currant flavors that are only just starting to shake hands with the oak. By 2016, it will be as good as it ever will get.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak and sawdust come with notes of plum and vanilla. The palate shows plum and black cherry along with evident oak, espresso and toasted sensations.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Judged against more familiar varietal wines, this Maturana comes across as unusual, but not bad. Herbal aromas of juniper and briny berry are typical for the grape. Flavors of stewed blueberry, juniper and herbs are naturally green-leaning and a bit odd. This is something to explore.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The blend is intriguing, consisting of Merlot, Zinfandel, Syrah and Petite Sirah, in that order. Each variety brings something to the bottle. It's dry, tannic and rich in blackberries, licorice, dark chocolate and spices, but the alcohol is quite high, giving it a porty finish. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A drier, lower alcohol and more streamlined Cab, it shows elegant control. Yet the fruit is Paso ripe, with blackberries veering into red currants, dark chocolate and raisins. The acidity is pronounced and a little uncomfortable. Drink it now, after careful decanting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red plum, leather and toasted oak aromas emerge in the glass. The hearty robust palate offers blackberry jam, dried black cherry, toasted hazelnut and clove framed in tightly packed but polished tannins. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Loaded with red berry, chopped herb and dark spice aromas, this zesty, medium-bodied red offers dried cherry, raspberry, ground pepper and clove flavors. It's savory but straightforward and not very persistent.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Youthful, bright and direct in its bold cherry and blueberry aromas. Vinous, chewy and raw with more evolution ahead. Chewy density with bold concentration and ripe fruit. Give it 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, deep and sappy, with the dark, licorice and coffee-infused complexity of Walla Walla's best bottles. Sharp and young, with a potent, liquorous finish, this explosive bottle of cassis-driven fruit should cellar well for a decade or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fine and delicate Brunello shows soft elegance and sophistication in the form of cassis, wild berry, white pepper, root beer, toasted nut and cigar tobacco. The mouthfeel is firm and clean, with elements of tannic structure and fresh acidity that work well together. The oak element still needs time to integrate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A Brunello with broad shoulders and a powerful bouquet that delivers bright, bold aromas of ripe fruit, dark spice, leather and dried tobacco. The wine's structure and dark fruit flavors move evenly over the palate with smoothness and harmony.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Delicate embroidered with sage, eucalyptus, cola, wild berry, white cherry, rum cake and savory spice, this wine shows the kind of pretty berry aromas that are brighter than they are intense. In fact, the wine shows elegant restraint with the potential for a beautiful evolution in the bottle.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A deliciously fruity wine, its bright apricot, pineapple and peach flavors open and generous. Of course, there is a more serious core of structure, lemon zest and dryness to promise aging. At the end, though, fruit and a light toastiness give immediate pleasure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Linear, focused and bright, with rich, fleshy fruit in the form of cherry, blackberry and spiced plum cake. This is a fleshy pretty wine with an elegant mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opulent tones of toasted espresso bean and soft chocolate fudge play a supporting role to bold berry and dried raspberry. Background floral tones of dried lavender and red rose. There's a touch of earthiness, too, with button mushroom and forest floor. Tannins are nicely polished and firm. Streamlined, elegant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tight, linear and compact. Clean, crisp and precise. Small berry aromas of cassis, wild berry and cherry are framed by firm, dusty tannins and a touch of toasted oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Shows a pretty, polished nose with dusty mineral notes backed by elegant tones of dried berry, spice and leather. Nice complexity and balance. Loads of tobacco-like sensations on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty ensemble of bright fruit, spice and cured meat, with ample concentration. Plump and round in the mouth, with loads of aromatic intensity. The mouthfeel is tight and chiseled.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bitter streak of herbal tea seasons a tight grip of tannin in this mountainous wine, structured and burly in wild sage and black cherry. A smoky undercurrent adds intrigue and savory, meaty notes that should be paired with appropriately hearty fare.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This 100% of Merlot from Tuscany opens with aromas of prune and raisin that recall uve passite or dried grapes. The palate offers concentrated fig, raisin and mocha and you'll also detect the warmth of evident alcohol. The overall lack of freshness makes this appear clunky and evolved.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bottling, from grapes grown in the winery's estate vineyard, has varied over the years. The 2011 vintage is not the finest expression, but it's a soft, easy-drinking Chardonnay with modest peach, pear and mango notes, along with substantial oak influence.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% varietal wine shows its warm-climate origins in the exceptionally ripe cherry, blackberry and dark chocolate flavors. It's also quite high in alcohol, which gives it some prickly heat as well as a raisiny, Port-like aftertaste.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, leather, wild berry and a balsamic note take the lead. The palate offers juicy Morello cherry, black raspberry, licorice and sage alongside rather astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black-skinned fruit, charred earth and a whiff of leather lead the nose. Ripe and straightforward, the palate offers dried black cherry, tobacco and a whiff of licorice alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, mature berry, new leather, blue flower and menthol emerge in the glass. On the firmly structured palate, an intense mineral vein of iron underscores dried black cherry, white pepper, dried sage and star anise. Austere fine-grained tannins provide the taut framework.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Named for nickel's number on the periodic table, this hillside vineyard site is located across Lake Hennessey on the eastern edge of the valley. Entirely varietal, it offers juicy layers highlighted in cedar, mountain sage and mellowed chocolate. The oak and tannin are well integrated and deeply embedded, providing support and structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a thick, dense and juicy Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, rich in currant, black cherry and blackberry.

An impressive effort from this winery\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094one of Montalcino's little known gems.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Campo Le\\u00c3\\u00b2n has herbal or green aromas that are unusual in Amarone. Those leafy elements are backed by ripe fruit, spice and toasted almond. It's round and full on the close with lingering berry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truffle, game and grilled sage aromas take center stage along with a floral note of red rose. The solid palate shows red berry, clove and white pepper while somewhat grainy tannins provide an assertive framework and a mouth-drying finish.

The aromas carry through to the palate, along with ripe apple and a hint of bread crust that are offset by crisp acidity and a creamy, refined perlage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of rose and baked apple lead the way on this vibrant sparkler. The lively palate delivers strawberry, nectarine zest and a note of bread crust alongside a firm, persistent pelage. An almond note closes the sharp finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its flavor that edges toward oxidative, this is the antithesis of easy, fruity white Bordeaux. That makes it an edgy, exciting wine, with spice, ginger and lychee flavors adding to the caramel wood over green plums.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There's a very fine wine lurking inside this bottle, but right now, everything's disjointed. There are big tannins over here, oak over there, and sandwiched in between are huge, intense flavors of blackberry, blueberry and cassis liqueur. It's nowhere near ready, but there's no reason why this dramatic young wine shouldn't come together and improve over the years. Cellar it until 2017 and check up on it; this could be really something in 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gorgeous and elegant, this demonstrates Tuscany's sweetest side. Trebbiano, Sangiovese and Malvasia undergo long aging to obtain impressive thickness and intensity of flavor. The lengthy finish is driven by notes of candied fruit, honey and brown sugar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine seems fruity, sweet and pure, with wonderfully bracing acidity and gentle tannins. The mouthfeel is light and graceful. Its notes of raspberry and smoky oak make it amazingly drinkable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This beautiful sparkler rested on its lees for 70 months, giving it extra smoothness and rich denseness. The bouquet is redolent of apricot, ripe fruit, melon and lightly toasted baguette. The mouthfeel is long, elegant and driven by fine perlage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This successful Pinot Noir from a difficult vintage treads an exciting line: It contains subtle notes of tomato and beetroot, but that vegetativeness only adds an earthy complexity to the ripe flavors of black cherry and plum. It's a fancy, elegant wine to drink now, and should gain traction over the next 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Although it's soft, it shows enough structure to support exceptionally ripe blackberry, black currant and spice flavors, with richness added by a heady note of liqueur. The tannins are substantial, and the wine is already throwing some sediment. Very nice now, and it should develop bottle nuance over the next 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the winery's highest quality wine, named in honor of their late winemaker, Guy Devaux, who brought a Champagne sensibility to the brand. At the age of eight years, it's softly complex and delicious in lime, raspberry, yeasty brioche and vanilla flavors. It has that hard to define quality of finesse that makes a fine sparkling wine so special.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fine and pure, this is a very good representative of Oak Knoll. The vintage had lots of warmth, coaxing ripe blackberry and currant flavors from the grapes, while preserving dryness, vital tannins and crisp acid structure. Overall, it is elegant and luscious. Good as it is now, give this at least six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Superbly ripe, with gorgeous blackberry jam, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis and toasted oak flavors.

The generous palate doles out juicy black cherry, blackberry, ground pepper and licorice while velvety tannins provide smooth, seamless support. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a muddled element to the nose here that recalls old wood or spice and in general, this wine lacks sharpness and focus. It tastes very sweet and offers high alcohol that keeps the palate ripping clean.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Distinctly Californian in the hugeness of the ripe fruit, just massive in blackberries and black cherries, liberally oaked and soft. Not particularly subtle at this time, but could do interesting things in the cellar. No guarantees.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Generally 88-pointers don't call for cellaring, but this one could gain style points with time in the bottle. Now it's dark and promising, with berry, cherry, earth and tobacco. It's also hard but manageable, with lightly herbal blackberry, cherry and brown sugar flavors. Finishes dark and toasty.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of espresso, leather, prune, toasted hazelnut and a whiff of dark spice. The palate is evolved, showing roasted coffee bean, raisin and licorice alongside somewhat astringent tannins. You'll also note a green sensation of powdered sage on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoked beef, tart and tangy boysenberry jelly, black rocks and a cigar-box scent power the nose of this wine from an award-winning vineyard. The palate offers ample juicy tang along with chewy tannins, with dark chocolate, black cherry, and black olive enlivening the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, woodland berry and spice aromas emerge in the glass.

Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (36%) and Petit Verdot from the Seven Hills and Loess vineyards, aromas of dried high-toned herb, cocoa and barrel spice intermingle on a wine that has yet to fully reveal its charms. The palate offers cranberry and dark-cherry flavors that create an exquisite sense of freshness and balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in tiny amounts in a light-bodied style, its vineyard site in the cool Petaluma Gap, this wine opens in earthy soapstone and sandalwood, offering an aroma of dried flowers. Delicate acidity supports a funkiness of cranberry, rhubarb and nutmeg, while a suggestion of roses lurks in the background.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine all comes from Block 46 of Les Collines Vineyard and was fermented 100% whole cluster in a mixture of concrete and stainless steel. This vineyard's signature violet aromas are accented by plum, smoked meat and herb. The palate is elegantly styled with tart, fresh acids and plenty of hang time on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and floral in pencil lead, this estate-grown wine is subdued in fruit, preferring instead to conjure savory and herbal notes from the glass. Tobacco, leather and wild anise support that context and statement, the texture roundly lush.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry, underbrush, mocha and baking spice aromas lead the nose on this hearty wine. The dense palate offers mature black plum, dill, clove and hints of black pepper alongside bracing tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made predominantly from Pinot Nero and with no added dosage, this sparkling wine delivers aromas of acacia flower, toasted almond and honey that carry over to the palate. It has a fine perlage and a bone-dry finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Acidity marks this wine, giving it a cut that streaks right down the middle of the blackberry, black cherry and cedar flavors. It's very dry, with rich, refined tannins, and that acidity will come in handy paired against a steak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This dry interpretation of the Cartizze cru shows chalky mineral notes with background tones of peach, honey, wild flower and lemon zest. The soft sweetness feels great next to the naturally foamy quality of the mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Creamy black cherry aromas layered with fresh brussel sprouts and spicy arugula flavors of red plums and toasted oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors.

Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke. Fleshy, long and full, this beautiful wine is not a monster, but it coats the palate with spicy flavors that epitomize class and style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautifully balanced wine, framed in plush, ripe, velvety tannins and backed by lush, black cherry, plum, blackberry, spice, herb and chocolate flavors. Gloriously complex, seamless in its elegance, the wine is packed with charm and personality; long on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ripe, rich and elegant, this wine is brimming with black plum, strawberry, cassis, chocolate, spice and herb notes. It's smooth-textured and seamlessly integrated, even at this early stage. Firm, plush tannins and just the right amount of toasty oak frame the ensemble.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leather, underbrush, baked plum, menthol and a whiff of cake spice are some of the aromas that lift out of the glass. The ripe palate delivers dried black cherry, fig, star anise, mocha, espresso and grilled sage while close-grained tannins provide the framework. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Jammy blueberry and prune aromas are ripe but a bit dull and rudimentary. Plump, chunky, jammy and tannic across the palate, this tastes like mashed blackberry and molasses. A finish that's warm and chubby but also tannic as rocks lacks some elegance and precision. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cherry, cassis and a cordial-like richness dominate in this medium-bodied blend of Cabernet Sauvignon with Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The fruit ripeness is elegantly offset by tobacco, leather and grippy tannin. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe dark fruit, menthol, tilled earth and underbrush aromas lead the nose along with a balsamic note. The palate is still a bit shy but eventually reveals mature berry, baking spice and a hint of truffle alongside fine-grained tannins. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a multi-aspected, redwood-surrounded site with peeks of the Pacific Ocean, Stuller traffics in aromas of baked bread and strawberry preserves, its acidity high-toned and full of freshness. Still young and looking for further development in the glass, it's savory and soft, aged in once-to-four-times used French oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The success of this wine owes as much to Merlot as to Cabernet. The Merlot has created the ripeness and smoothness of the wine. While the Cabernet keeps it firm and closed up, there is a base of rich, sweet fruit here that will show over the next two years. The style of the wine is moving away from elegance to power under the new regime of owners, Champagne Roederer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Good Cabernet character all around. The nose is spicy and full, with tobacco, pepper and red berry fruit to start. On the palate, good tannic structure and a balance of big fruit, leather/tobacco and acid offer ageability and finesse.

Oaky flavors of ripe blackberry and cassis are rooty and leathery, while this tastes of chocolate and fig on a broad finish. Drink through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard has done well in warm years such as 2008, but in the chilly 2011 vintage, it's tart with acidity. A cranberry bite dominates all else, from the red currant flavors to the spicy, vanilla-accented oak from barrels.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This intense wine opens with an alluring fragrance of crushed flower, vineyard dust, bright berry, leather, cooking spices and balsamic notes. The structured palate delivers ripe black cherry, prune, cracked black pepper, toast and licorice alongside vibrant acidity.

Remarkably low in alcohol, (12.9%) it nonetheless tastes fully formed, mid-weight with a touch of oak on the finish, a testament to incredible raw ingredients and respectful winemaking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe, savory and smoky up front, this is oozing blackberry, cassis, bacon and leather aromas. The palate on this minerally Rioja is as juicy, ripe and fresh as they come.

Give it two or three years in the cellar to soften and mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opulent as well as elegant, this structured red boasts aromas of black currant, exotic spice, new oak and fragrant blue flower. Made entirely with native grape Corvina, the velvety palate doles out spiced blackberry, juicy cherry, licorice and black pepper.

Exotic aromas of leather, lemon peel, sawdust and boysenberry come in front of a tannic but lively and intricate palate. Baked, heady flavors of black fruits, pepper and mocha finish with chocolate and vanilla as well as juicy acidity. Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the winery's first Kanzler Vineyard Pinot Noir and its only Sonoma Coast appellation Pinot. The cool-climate vineyard offers ripe cherry and plum around a core of firm, velvety tannins. From there, vibrant cranberry and rhubarb flirt with black tea, while red apple, sage and sandalwood notes round out the flavors on the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This firm, dark and still young wine has intense acidity that comes from the red currant and raspberry fruit. The tannins though form the real basis of this concentrated wine. Great juicy fruits at the end will develop well. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smoke, graphite, blue flower, cedar and black pepper aromas take center stage on this bold, structured wine. Velvety tannins support the dense black cherry, plum and blackberry flavors, while notes of freshly ground pepper and nutmeg add depth. Thanks to fresh acidity it's already surprisingly drinkable but it also displays aging potential. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dominated at this young stage by wood, this is a potentially rich and creamy wine. Its structure shines through, full and generous. The fruits and the acidity still have to develop, but already the wine is showing the rounded character of a great Pouilly Fuiss\\u00c3\\u00a9. It's a wine to age, so drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard within what locals call the Petaluma Gap, a cool area duly influenced by Pacific Ocean fog, this wine is intense in berry and bright, lush, spicy layers indicative of its cooler leanings. Pleasing, with clove and black tea between the fruit, it's approachable and impressive.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Generous notes of ripe pear has edges of blossom and peach on the nose. The palate underlines the peachy notes with a judicious boosting touch of residual sweetness. A pleasantly bitter edge, reminiscent of pear peel, adds welcome texture while lemony brightness provides freshness and verve. The finish is off dry and very appetizing with its lovely balance of fruit and brightness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is fragrant and ripe while having a balanced, delicate structure. It offers plenty of fruit and acidity, with dusty tannins and sweet berry flavors. It should develop well and quickly. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This perfumed wine features ripe tannins and strawberry flavors. It is structured, with good concentration and acidity. The wine is developing well with the richness as well as line of fresher acidity. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas suggesting toast, menthol, mature berry, coffee and a balsamic note. On the full-bodied palate, notes of white pepper, cinnamon and powdered sage accent dried black cherry while firm, close-grained tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Initially a bit shy, this slowly opens in the glass to reveal aromas of ripe berry, leather, baking spice and a hint of scorched earth. The palate offers suggestions of raspberry compote, dried black cherry, vanilla and licorice alongside tightly wound tannins. A marked espresso note closes the finish. Drink after 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big tannin and burly toasted oak make for a full-bodied, robust entry into this concentrated wine. It offers an undeniable hit of Dr. Pepper and wild mushrooms grown on a forest floor.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toast, underbrush and a whiff of wet fur lead the nose. The structured palate offers hazelnut, crushed raspberry and grilled herb alongside assertive tannins that give it a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a sophisticated and rich white wine with pretty hues of stone fruit, almond and honeysuckle. The wine boasts thick density and long-lasting fruit flavors. Pair it with poached Norwegian salmon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very dark wine from the Kama Sutra-inspired winery, with aromas of creosote and blueberry. The flavors are quite thick with blackberry juice, balanced with pangs of acidity yet finishing on the soft side.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tar and black fruit emerge from the shadows of big tannins that pucker on the palate, begging for more time to soften. Robust and full bodied with a warm ripeness, it finishes flat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of dark plum, tobacco, cooking spice and a balsamic note. The dense palate delivers black currant, licorice and clove set against round, polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: New leather, blue flower, espresso, chopped herb and mature plum aromas lead the way. The dense palate offers black cherry, blackberry, sage, clove and star anise set against firm fine-grained tannins that leave an assertive finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Earthy aromas of truffle, underbrush, tilled soil and mature dark-skinned fruit take shape on this full-bodied red.

Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another 100% Syrah from the producer aged in two-thirds new French oak for 18 months, this has a dullness around the fruit, a sourness almost, that is not otherwise sparked by its notes of meat and gunpowder.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a great wine lurking inside big, hard tannins, but it's going to take some time to express itself. If you chew the wine, you'll discover a core of intensely ripe black berries and currants. The finish is thoroughly dry and spicy in cinnamon, clove and black pepper, with hints of cocoa. Stash this in the cellar until 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The eucalyptus in this wine detracts from what else might be going on. It provides a medicinal atmosphere that's hard to shake, leading the way to a lean, bitter finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A big Cabernet, showing the dramatic mouthfeel that well-made Napa Cabernet always has. It's full bodied, dry and softly tannic, with classic blackberry and currant flavors. Should hold in the bottle for about six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy, oaky, leathery berry and spice aromas come around nicely with airing. This is a plump Rioja with modern leanings; it has good structure and pretty raspberry and cassis flavors. A round finish hints at raisiny maturity but doesn't overdo the ripeness. Drink through 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet is a guaranteed cellar candidate. It's enormously rich and extracted, with flavors of blackberries, currants, plums and mocha, but finishes firm, dry and tannic. Give it at least four more years in a cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big-time tannins make this blend of all five classic Bordeaux varieties tight in character. Underneath the astringency are intense flavors of blackberries, cherries and currants that are liberally oaked. Dry and refined, the wine will develop bottle complexity after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in the modern cult style, this soft, ripely lush Cabernet is immediately likeable for its blackberry-pie filling, black currant liqueur, chocolate, licorice and smoky sweet oak flavors. It's California Cabernet at its heady, opulent best. Drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tough to appreciate now due to its acidity and tannins, which lock it down behind a cloak of impenetrability. There are exotic wild raspberry and cherry fruit, cola, licorice, Proven\\u00c3\\u00a7al herb, bacon and pepper flavors, but you can't quite get to them, because they're behind bars. Obviously needs time. Give it 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years in the cellar, and it should begin to blossom after that.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A strong, powerful Pinot that's nowhere ready to drink. That's despite massive blackberry, cherry, cola, red currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors that dazzle the palate. The tannins are potent, the acidity is tart and the finish is bone dry. Obviously needs time in the bottle. Try after 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the dreamy Mediterranean paradise known as Sardinia comes this opulent dessert blend of Nasco and Malvasia Bianca. The syrupy wine exhibits a dark amber-copper color with aromas of toasted almond, butterscotch, caramel, dried apricot and candied fruit. It shows density and grit, and yes, there's even a touch of piquant spice on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Marked by gritty tannins and a tang of acidity, this non-vintage Bordeaux blend turns rich in blackberry and black currant flavors on the midpalate. It's very dry, despite the sweet fruit. You can drink it now, but it's tannic enough to hold over at least the next eight years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: After years of trying, Alpha Omega finally hits the bullseye. It's everything you want in a fine Chardonnay, with ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, a rich oaky, creamy overlay and bracing acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This subtle, classically-styled red includes 6% Merlot, all of the fruit hailing from the producer's organic Chiles Valley estate. It's bright with red and blue fruit and earthy accents of mushroom and clove. Moderate tannin buoy it without bogging it down, giving it broadness on the palate and carrying its flavors long into the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This just-released ten-year-old selection opens with inviting aromas of plum, leather, underbrush and tobacco. The approachable enveloping palate doles out mouthfuls of mature black cherry, grilled herb, cured meat, truffle and a hint of licorice framed in supple tannins. It has hit its ideal drinking window so enjoy soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This rich, firmly structured wine comes from a nine-acre vineyard close to the village of Pommard. Its ripe black fruits are just starting to show through the dry core. Concentrated and powerful, it will be best from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Forest floor, dark cooking spice, chopped mint, coconut and baked plum aromas lead the way on this full-bodied red. The robust juicy palate doles out black cherry, raisin, espresso, clove and anise while firm fine-grained tannins provide plenty of structure. An espresso note closes the tight finish. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Peppery and meaty, this 100% varietal wine is sourced from select estates around the valley. With lively acidity beneath its rich, ripe blackberry and cassis flavors, it shows sturdy tannin and a mild finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With crushed strawberry and caramel flavors, this is relatively light wine, though elegant and pierced with acidity. Milk chocolate and soft tannins complete an attractive ensemble.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of Barbaresco's most celebrated vineyard crus, this ruby-colored wine exhibits loads of intensity and power in the form of cherry, cassis, leather, tar and cola. The wine's compact, tonic mouthfeel would make a great companion to rich, sophisticated cuisine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With grapes from Yountville, this Bordeaux blend, which is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, has a very fine structure. It's firm in tannins and acidity, with a bracing minerality. The flavors are already quite advanced, suggesting jammy cherries, blackberries and cassis. Drink now for sheer deliciousness, after decanting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from equal parts Zinfandel and Petite Sirah, this blend seems to detract from the purity of both. The result is interesting and even dramatic in ripeness, but a little muddied, with hard tannins making it tough despite a rich center of blackberry and cherry jam.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: New wood flavors go over the structured fruit and give currant flavors. It is already coming into balance and is for medium-term aging. The vineyard is on the plain beneath the hill of Saint-\\u00c3\\u0089milion.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot features a dark ruby color and balanced aromas of black fruit, leather, spice and rum cake. It's fresh and fruity in the mouth, with just the right measure of concentration to pair with lasagna.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bold, leathery and savory wine, this offers dark chocolate and black pepper within a soft layering of full-bodied approachability and ripe, red berry and currant.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very good wine, rich and packed with flavor. A dry and softly tannic, it floods the mouth with cassis, red currant, blueberry, plum, cocoa and smoky oak flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has earthy aromas suggesting underbrush, new leather, menthol and truffle, along with a whiff of medicinal herb. The palate is tightly wound and still rather closed, offering hints of espresso, anise and raw berry framed by drying, close-grained tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Le Chiuse has produced one of Montalcino's brightest stars with this Riserva 2004 (the base 2004 Brunello didn't impress us as nearly much). This is a delicious wine that you will enjoy on every level. The intensity and purity of the fruit and spice aromas are impressive and the mouthfeel is extra-plush and supple. Yet, those firm tannins give it the balance and structure it needs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Violets and compost dance through the aromas, leading into an intensely fruity palate loaded with sappy berry richness, nuanced with scents and streaks of cured meat, garrigue, earth and graphite. Blending 77% Syrah with 23% Cabernet Sauvignon, it strikes a perfect balance among fruit, earth, and rock. At its core it is still wrapped tight, immaculately clean, and still almost impenetrably dense.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The top ros\\u00c3\\u00a9 from Sacha Lichine's Esclans estate, this is wood aged and the flavors of wood are apparent, if subtle. The wine has a great smooth texture, the fruit well integrated, showing richness as well as elegance. Not classic Provence, but certainly impressive.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of menthol, mature dark-skinned berry and a whiff of cellar floor lead the way. On the palate, notes of coffee, white pepper and grilled herb accent fleshy wild cherry alongside solid, assertive tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blueberry fruit, purple flowers and licorice break through the very dense cloud of finely knit tannins that frame the entire experience of this best-of-house bottling. Dark-roast coffee beans and hints of blackberry fruit can be found once sipped, but this needs years to evolve. Luckily, it has the excellent tannins and bright acidity needed to do so.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alidis is not the most consistent winery in Ribera del Duero, but this gran reserva gets it mostly right. Earthy, slightly mulchy and rubbery berry aromas lead to a saturated bulky palate. Saucy earthy flavors of black fruits finish gritty and a bit leathery, with a jammy weight and a lasting note of black coffee.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tannic and robust, this reserve-tier wine offers smoothly chiseled tannin and full-bodied flavors like brick, black cherry, leather and clove. It begs to be paired with hearty meat dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This ripe wine comes from organic vineyards in the village of Brochon, next to Gevrey-Chambertin. It shows plenty of structure, a tantalizing smoky character from wood aging and juicy red fruit character. This will be a delicious wine to drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine has a classic personality: round and soft in tannin, with a chalkiness lurking behind herbal tobacco leaf, tomato, cedar and rose notes. Full-bodied, it doesn't hold back on ripeness but displays more savory character than fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Smashed blueberries, cracked peppercorns and pressed purple flowers show on the nose of this bottling. The palate is sour-leaning with dried plum and pine needle flavors, held together by sticky tannins that are mouth-coating and a bit tense.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of oak, leather, plum, vanilla and espresso unfold in the glass. The concentrated palate doles out dried black cherry, blackberry jam, oak-driven spice and licorice alongside firm, fine-grained tannin. This has weight and a velvety texture but it isn't overly vibrant, so drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From both Sun Chase and Gap's Crown vineyards, two stellar sites that neighbor one another, this is a medium-bodied expression of high-toned pomegranate and cherry. It unleashes big, soft waves of intense flavor and texture expansively and with panache.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Reduced, jammy aromas of boysenberry, plum and blueberry set up a woody, choppy feeling palate with tannins that need to mellow. Raisiny berry flavors are on the heavy side, while residual oak notes are prominent. A tannic, drawing finish is dense, woody and in need of settling. Drink through 2030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Crushed aromatic herb, rose and red berry aromas take shape in the glass. The bright, structured palate is still very young, showing tart red cherry, chopped mint and cinnamon accompanied by firm tannins and vibrant acidity. A mineral note signals the close. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From an 850-foot-elevation site four miles from the ocean, this offers a depth of dark cherry and Asian spice, lightly bodied and textured. It delivers a hit of bittersweet chocolate on the tangy finish, with an intriguing streak of charcuterie that's hard to shake.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of pressed rose petal, roasted herb and a funky but not unpleasant trace of game lead the way. The gamey note carries through to the ripe, chewy palate, together with juicy Morello cherry, raspberry compote, mint, clove and mineral while a saline note closes the finish. It's still young and tannic, but shows a certain rustic charm. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with earthy\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094almost funky\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094aromas of game, truffle, leather, a hint of overripe dark-skinned fruit and a balsamic note. The palate offers black cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and chopped herb alongside ripe tannins. An anise note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Now maturing, this retains its red fruits; its bright texture and acidity go with the firm tannins and dark structure. It is balanced and ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This textured and toasty wine shows a gentle acidity through its spice and warm apple and apricot flavors. Its mineral edge is tangy, zesty and attractive. Built to age for the medium term, it will be ready drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dry wine with firm tannins over the juicy red-cherry fruits. It is structured, while likely to develop well over the next few years. The wood and fruit are both attractive at this stage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Passr\\u00c3\\u00ac di Scrapona is a highly concentrated and rich dessert wine that shows very nice aromatic balance and intensity. Aromas here include toasted almond, apricot, honeysuckle and loads of honey. The wine feels syrupy and shows big weight and density on the long, sweet finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There is a great balance here between the creamy fruit and the wood flavors. Apricots, ripe apples and melon are spiced with the right amount of toastiness. The wine has a rich, warm feel. It is still young, so wait until 2015 to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Because strong toast aromas show through this wine, its attractive full fruit will need time to come through. The wine, with its firm, almost red-wine structure, needs to age until 2016 before drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing richness, this wine is smooth and well balanced between ripe red berry fruits and generous tannins. The wood aging shows in a slight burnt edge, but this will pass as the wine develops. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, coconut and dried black fruit slowly take shape in the glass. Made entirely with Merlot, the dense palate offers blackberry extract, black cherry, coffee and grilled sage alongside rather astringent tannins that dry out the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine starts with an enticing, perfumed spicy aroma. Once sipped, a big burst of dry tannins coats the mouth and makes the mild fruit flavors seem thin and spare in the middle. The structure and the texture seem to need more richness and depth from the flavors. Drink after 2020 to let the tannins mellow out.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the north of the Margaux appellation, this is a wine that has tense, acidic, black berry fruits, soft tannins and a light, juicy character. Not for long-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hints of menthol and leather lead the nose on this robust red. The hearty, monolithic palate offers dried black cherry, clove and a hint of tobacco alongside firm tannins. You'll also detect the warmth of evident alcohol on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: To say the least, it comes out guns blazing and oozing mountain character. Animal and barnyard, coffee and earth, even burnt toast and smoky bacon are all over this wine. Fruit definitely plays second fiddle to the dark, earthy essence of this Cabernet, Merlot and Cab Franc trio.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, leather and herbaceous notes on the nose open to cherry, currant and tobacco flavors\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094it's all very much in the Bordeaux vein. The mouthfeel is similar: somewhat lean and angular but very flavorful, with an expansive cherry flavor on the spicy, long finish. Has good tannic structure, and may merit a higher score with some age. Hold for four to six years, and then drink til 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black fruit with a touch of prune and meat on the nose. Oak-lashed plums and currants in the mouth taste a bit burnt from the wood treatment. A woody express train, with lots of coffee. Fans of dark, structured, oaky wines will get a kick out of this one.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend. Very mature, almost raisiny fruit and dark-chocolate flavors cover the palate. A full finish with tobacco notes wraps up this very masculine package. Hold until 2005.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Crisp in the nose, with nuances of graham cracker, menthol, mushroom and herbs. Those herbal notes carry into the flavor profile and mix with plum and oak. It opens up a little and becomes fairly friendly on the finish, where the tannins are medium.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Packed in upfront, with some atypical grassy, wildflower aromas. Chunky fruit and Port-like flavors make a statement, as does a black-tea note on the finish. Slightly clumsy now, the hope here is that some time in the cellar will help weld any incongruent elements.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With some firm structure, this wine also has great fruitiness. It offers plenty of raspberry fruits, good acidity and a solid texture of tannins. The acidity keeps the wine perfumed and fresh. Drink the wine from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of this wine show considerable wood. On the palate, the wood is very present, giving acidity as well as layers of toast and spice. Hints of yellow fruit show through, suggesting the possibility of a ripe, rich wine in the future. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rose, iris, ripe red berry and aromatic herbs are some of the aromas you'll discover in this wine. It's both focused and juicy, delivering succulent Marasca cherry, crushed raspberry, mint and licorice alongside a backbone of fined-grained tannins that leave a firm finish. Bright acidity provides balance. Drink 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932043.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine, with its firm tannins and solid structure, is still young. The hints of black-plum fruits are way behind the structure. That's all good, because this wine will come together well, to give a rich full wine with spice, juicy black fruits and acidity. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing scents of woodland berry, new leather, blue flower and baking spice meld together in the glass.

The alcohol and oak are dialed back, allowing the fruit to shine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Softened by 20% Merlot, this wine tastes of chocolate-covered clove and spicy dried herb, the robust layers of flavor cradled in toasted oak. Fresh and brooding, it offers forest pine, black currant and tobacco in a refined package of integrated tannin.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard that's less than one acre in size, this special bottling is tiny but mighty, juicy in blue and red fruit. Robust in spice, it unleashes a velvety texture with ease, allowing room for focused tannin to be supportive rather than distracting. The finish retains a welcome freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy aromas of truffle, forest floor, woodland berry, mint and new leather escape the glass.

Developing well, it will be ready to drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is firm, solid and dense with ripe black fruits.

Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very high-toned, wound-up nose slowly reveals chalky aromas, concentrated purple fruit and crushed violets on this bottling by the Daou brothers.

There\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s a hint of truffles, of bark, and you almost have to close your eyes to imagine the blackberries and cherries buried deep down inside, but they\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099re there.

Most of the fruit has dried up, giving it a lean quality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine rewards in full-bodied weight and lushness, its color additionally dark and brooding thanks to the addition of 11% Petit Verdot.

It's brawny and bold but the refined tannins also lend a measure of finesse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark raspberry, barrel spice and smoke aromas are followed by medium-bodied fruit flavors. The tannins bring a slight sense of astringency. Perhaps some time in the bottle will help them settle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet deserves its reserve status.

Buried deep down is a pirate's treasure of ripe, intense blackberry fruit. New oak, to the tune of 94%, doesn't cloud the wine, suggesting this blend's its intensity and concentration.

Far from a blockbuster style, it's all about elegance and detail.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fragrant and structured, this opens with aromas of wild berry, menthol, leather, tilled soil and aromatic herbs. The palate doles out wild cherry, fleshy black raspberry, cinnamon, white pepper and anise.

On the palate, notes of white pepper, grilled herbs and tobacco accent the black cherry core while a backbone of assertive but refined tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This burly, robust wine is smoky in oak, with a twist of cedar and sage.

But once it does, black plum and dried purple flowers arise on the nose, and then a strong tannic structure slowly reveals flavors of pepper and boysenberry on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At the southern end of Nuits Saint-Georges, this vineyard produces a ripe and full style of wine.

They follow through to the palate, which offers coffee bean and sage notes in place of fruit richness. Grainy tannins leave a raspy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Prune, leather, oak and balsamic aromas lead the nose of this wine.

The suggestion is ageability, but the wine seems to lack the dynamic tension to ride out the years. It has plenty of ripe blackberry fruit, but snaps to a quick finish. Quite good, but a disappointing expression of the Stagecoach Vineyard.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine that brings out soft richness, with a creamy apple texture layered with green plum skin tannins.

There's a great mineral, steely streak, with freshness showing through on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dark density sets the tone and so do thick aromas of vanilla bean, toasted oak and coffee. The wine is firm but smooth and offers a blast of cherry freshness on the close. With all the oak, it's hard to find Sangiovese's naturally delicate nuances. Big, bold red wine enthusiasts will love it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tough and gritty in youth, this Pinot is showing edgy tannins, tart acidity and unincorporated oak. It's almost like a barrel sample. But it's stuffed with currant, licorice and mocha flavors, and should develop well in the bottle. Try after 2009.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, chopped herb, toast and a whiff of French oak are some of the aromas that take shape in the glass. The palate is taut but elegant, offering bright wild cherry, licorice and vanilla flavors, while tightly wound, fine-grained tannins leave a firm finish. Give this time to unwind and fully develop.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Chopped herb, pine, forest floor and balsamic notes follow through to the palate, rich in vibrant red cherry, cranberry, star anise and white pepper notes. It's still tightly wound, with compact tannins and fresh acidity. Give it time to develop more depth and complexity. Drink 2022\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932032.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This top-shelf red blend from television producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick shows cooked blackberry, purple flower, soy and anise aromas on the nose. Oregano and marjoram lead the palate, which is moderately dense, with tangy blackberry and boysenberry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A slight apple scent perfumes the nose. The palate expresses more tart apple fruit and shows a central line of taut lemony freshness. The flavors are very clean and might need a little cellar age to come into their own. The finish is clean and dry. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a delightfully fresh yet creamy wine that delivers a spectrum of styles and flavors. Anise and tart apple notes accent the floral-driven experience, unfettered by oak, which plays but a supporting role.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big grapy aromas of blackberry and cassis are rather heavy and flat. This has a tannic abrasive mouthfeel in which nothing is smooth. Borderline overripe flavors of baked plum and blackberry finish chocolaty and with baking-spice flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft, supple and mouth-coating, this wine dances in cola, forest floor and subtle red and black berry, building power and concentration as it goes. Already given time in bottle, it's ready to enjoy now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The winery's top-end Bordeaux red, this blends 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Cabernet Franc, 19% Petit Verdot and 15% Malbec. The fruit is sourced from the family's estate vineyard on the eastern slopes of the Napa Valley, then aged 20 months in French oak, 90% of it new. Black in color, it tastes of cedar and smoke, with soft layers of subtle plum and cassis before a grippy finish. Enjoy through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend with a splash of Syrah. It's made in the modern cult style of softness, extracted fruit and plenty of toasty oak. With blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors, it's obviously delicious, yet has a certain generic quality. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% Cabernet sure is oaky, but the butterscotch, toast and caramel flavors blend in seamlessly with the fruit, which is of gargantuan proportions. It's intense in mountain-concentrated blackberries, black currants and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis, with a complex note of green olives and mint. Just at the beginning of a long life, it will develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Take a hot year like 2009 and combine it with a hot region like Toro and what you get is this rich, ribald wine. Heavy aromas of raisin and blackberry suggest maximum ripeness. A beefy, saturated palate houses dark flavors of prune, chocolate and baked plum, while the finish is dark, toasty, chewy and a pure reflection of the Toro region. Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A dense wine, rich and smooth for a Nuits-St-Georges, full of ripe red fruits, dark cherries and acidity that almost gives the wine a fresh character. Behind this fruitiness is a more solid, dark structure of tannins that will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the winery's top brut, and what a gorgeous wine it is. Blended equally with Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, it shows lime, tangerine and strawberry flavors that are subtle and rich. The mousse is very fine, giving it a silky texture. Beautiful to drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Amarone has a fragrance that recalls black cherry and licorice, along with a hint of well-integrated oak. The palate offers raspberry, ripe cherry and spicy notes of white pepper and clove. Smooth and well balanced, it closes on an almond note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's no denying this wine's force. It's 15% ABV but balanced, with roasted berry, leather, toasty oak, graphite and prune aromas. The palate feels full, flush and without gaps, while flavors of blackberry, cassis, chocolate and spice finish exceedingly smooth, with loamy notes and leftover spice. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A very subdued nose leads to a rather earthy, dry palate where all the fruit hides behind some slightly rounded lemon freshness. There is gradually more apple fruit with some air and an earthy finish with a long, fresh, lemony tang.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This beautifully perfumed wine comes from one of the highest in elevation premier cru vineyards. The tannins have fully integrated with the red berry and cherry fruits to give a soft, jammy character that contrasts with acidity to give a great lift at the end. Drink this sophisticated wine from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, cured meat, grilled herb, menthol and dark-skinned fruit aromas unfold in the glass. The chewy palate offers dried black berry, black cherry, licorice, coffee and toasted nut alongside tightly packed tannins. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Still young and firm, this wine gives indications of potential fruitiness along with a structure that promises concentration. Layers of black fruits and acidity need time to integrate fully with the dark structure and dense texture. Wait to drink this wine for a few more years, at least until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a selection of vineyard sites and clones, this wine offers juicy acidity behind a wave of plummy red and black cherry, an earthy foundation keeping things real. Oak and tannins are well integrated, and plenty of clove flavor make for a spicy finish. This gets extra attention for the awesome label.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Mature black plum, roasted coffee bean, sunbaked earth and vanilla aromas emerge in the glass.

Generous tannins give additional weight to the overall concentration. The finish feels dusted with spicy clove.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, tobacco, used leather, scorched earth and a suggestion of oak slowly take shape in the glass. On the palate, round velvety tannins underscore raspberry compote, dried cherry and baking spice. It's rather forward so drink over the next several years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Bialla has held back this 2008 for release nearly a year after the lovely 2009. The wine is soft, complex and drinkable now, with blackberry jam and oak flavors, but it's definitely high in alcohol, which gives it a cellar-limiting heat.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A more intense version of Carraovejas's Reserva from 2012, this also includes more than 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Thus it's spicy and prickly on the nose, with road tar and peppery notes in addition to potent berry fruit. A rich saturated rumbling palate deals coffee, toast, blackberry and herbal flavors that are much like the Reserva but more amplified. A charred finish has a lemony ring to it. Drink from 2020 through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aged in wood, this wine is rich and spicy. Its fruit though is beautifully in balance, ripe with raspberry and red-currant fruits that are shot through with lemon acidity. This is a full-bodied wine, impressively structured and likely to age for a year or two. It is named after the 946 steps up the mountain behind the estate. Drink from late 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Like it's bigger sibling El Anej\\u00c3\\u00b3n, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dominated by the local Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre grapes, this is a ripe and complex wine. Its acidity is integrated with rich yellow fruits, spice and perfume. The wine is floral, poised and very stylish. Drink from late 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truffle, game and grilled sage aromas take center stage along with a floral note of red rose.

The oak is there but not ridiculously so.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Balsamic notes, leather, tilled soil, ripe berry and menthol aromas lead the nose along with a whiff of blue flower. The smooth palate shows fleshy black cherry, white pepper, grilled herb and baking spice framed in supple tannins. Open an hour in advance to let this breathe. Already approachable, it will also age well for several years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is firm and structured, with dark tannins and a dense texture that is still dry. It offers ripe fruit as well as acidity, currently overshadowed by the tannins but will come to the fore with some time. The wine will age well, thanks to the solid structure and dry core of tannins. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is pure and fruity, with a strong, tight line of minerality. It is perfumed with apple and grapefruit flavors and a light touch of wood, with good acidity at the end. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is big and ripe with layers of tannins and attractive fruitiness. Bright acidity comes from the strawberry and red-cherry fruit. The drier structure is integrating well, with plenty of richness behind. The wine will develop well; drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This crisp wine is currently tightly closed. It is textured and mineral, with apple and citrus flavors coming through slowly. This perfumed wine needs to age. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Offered in remembrance of winery co-founder, Emily Miner, this wine is softened by 5% Cabernet Franc, the grapes coming from a handful of vineyards, including Stagecoach and Emilio's Terrace. Dried herb, graphite and sagebrush highlight a tight structure that's grippy and savory, with understated oak. Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe dark-skinned fruit, leather, clove, rose and a whiff of menthol set the tone.

It has all the faults of a hot Zinfandel: semisweet baked-fruit flavors, a lack of acidity, and a resulting medicinal quality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark berry, blue flower, brown spice, espresso and balsamic aromas take shape in the glass. The structured palate offers black cherry, clove, coffee and licorice alongside close-grained tannins that give the finish a youthful grip. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black currant stars in this mountain wine, juicy and brushy in big, pillowy tannin. Still tightly wound, it shows complexity and plenty of natural structure, begging for more time in the bottle to allow for the gunpowder, smoky oak and dark, lush black fruit to marry further. It should show best 2020 through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Carm\\u00c3\\u00a9n\\u00c3\\u00a8re, Malbec and Cabernet Franc offers aromas of purple fruit, green herb, clove, barrel spice and spice box. It's light and supple, filling out with palate-coating fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of grip that softens with additional time open. Put it on the dinner table to see it at its best.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard named for the oceanic deposits found there, this bottling offers blackberry syrup, vanilla, clove and black tea aromas. Like the nose, the palate offers a minty lift to its boysenberry and blackberry fruit. It's framed by strong acidity and soft tannins that build after several sips.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This small-production wine from two spectacular sites in the Petaluma Gap is robustly earthy and spicy, showing compost and blue fruit flavor. Broadly structured, it expands on the palate, its finish dotted with black tea and clove.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a site in Calistoga, this wine delivers juicy tobacco, char and black fruit flavors, with a concentrated structure and new French and American oak. Savory leather and black pepper notes close out the long finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big, rich, and dramatic are just a few words that describe this 100% Cabernet grown on the low-yielding estate vineyard in Coombsville. It's lush with black currants, yet bracing in tannins, with a minerality that makes it feel firm and grounded. The barrels are 100% new French oak, lending a savory level of char and vanilla. This is clearly a wine to cellar for a long time. Start enjoying it in 2018, and it is likely to develop bottle complexity throughout the 2020s.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Credit the cool vintage for this Pinot's mouthwatering acidity. The wine is rich but pristine with fruit, a testament to Phelps' superb viticultural practices and attention to detail at the sorting table. It's dry and crisp, yet rich and delicious, with flavors of strawberry and raspberry jam, rosehip tea and cedar. The tannins give the wine a velvety grip. As good as it is now, it would be a shame not to cellar it. Your window of drinkability begins in 2019 and extends for 15 years after.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of Trimbach's top wines, this impressive Riesling, with all its bottle time, is maturing beautifully. It has that petrol character that is typical of aged Riesling, as well as a strong sense of steeliness and intense acidity on the finish. It is probably at its peak now, but will drink well until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: After a great inaugural 2010 vintage, this is another impressive Cabernet from this winery. The vineyard is in the Pritchard Hill area, and the wine is 95% Cabernet with 5% Petit Verdot. It's a lush wine that's rich in black currant, cocoa and plum flavors, enhanced by smoky oak. The wine shows enormous complexity, with layers of minerals and dried herbs that are hard to describe. It has a long life ahead of it, so drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022, at least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A worthy followup to the splendid 2008 and 2009 vintages, this 100% Cabernet is a blend of grapes from St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville.

Steely, tight, very nervy and bone dry, it is packed with flavors of citrus, orange zest, grapefruit and green apple skins. The texture of this young wine is beautifully crisp. Drink from 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, grown in the winery's estate vineyard, on the east side of Napa Valley. It's awesomely rich and ripe, delivering heady blackberry, blueberry, cassis liqueur, cola and new oak flavors that are as long in the finish as they are deep. With thick tannins, it's clearly a wine you need to cellar. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The initial impression of this wine is lean and austere. Lively acidity and a firm, dark, magnificent structure brings out intense flavors of plum skins. It needs several years in the bottle to show its best. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Although certainly sweet, this wine is much more than that. Alongside the honey and syrup flavors are intensely bright pineapple flavors and lively acidity. It's the balance of this wine that is so impressive, with all the elements properly in place. Drink now and until 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Typically dark in color, with plum, blackberry and a touch of raisin on the nose, this feels a bit jammy, with a shock of acidity and hard tannins. Prune, baked plum and baking-spice flavors finish toasty and charred, with dry rough tannins. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with black-skinned berry, scorched earth and cooking spice aromas.

Youthfully assertive and austere, the palate offers toasted oak, licorice and espresso notes, set against a backdrop of bracing tannins that grip the finish. That structure should mellow and integrate with a few more years of bottle age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark-skinned berry, underbrush and leather are some of the aromas you'll find in this juicy Brunello.

Give the tannins another few years to unclench then drink to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red berry, chopped herb, moist underbrush and new leather lead the way. The firm palate is less inviting than the nose, offering dried cherry, roasted coffee bean and grilled sage set against bracing grainy tannins that leave a somewhat raspy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe black plum, cooking spice and scorched earth lead the nose. The robust, bulky palate offers prune, dried cherry, vanilla and a hint of white pepper set against bracing tannins while the heat of scorching alcohol throws it off balance.

The tannins here have a touch more astringency and grit but this thickly extracted wine ends with soft, yielding succulence and gorgeous cherry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tannins weigh this Syrah down, making it toughly astringent, a wine that makes your mouth pucker. Through all that, you can taste the massive flavors of black currants, red licorice, violets, cloves and peppery grilled veal that are pure, dry and profound. Is it an ager? The pedigree suggests yes. The wine is a blend of the Caldwell, Stagecoach and Hyde-Oak Knoll vineyards. Stash it through mid-2009, if not longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the estate vineyard on Spring Mountain comes this dense, powerful Syrah. It's a big wine, packed with black currants and chocolate and sturdy tannins that are a bit astringent right now.

Overripe, raisinated notes lend a touch of bitterness and high alcohol makes it finish a tad hot.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, tough and totally dry, this has blackberry and currant flavors.

There is a tautness and minerality that adds complexity to the pineapple and spice flavors. The wine opens well in the mouth, ripeness and full fruit flavors melding easily. Delicious.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Ripe and soft, here is a Chanson white that hasn't been overwhelmed by wood. Instead, the delicious yellow and white stone fruits come through, with a creamy edge reminiscent of buttered English muffins, finishing on a high note of juicy, thirst-quenching acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tight, vivid wine that expresses pure Chardonnay with a steely eye. The wine is flinty, the green fruits and apple skin texture dominant. There is some wood, but the lightest touch. The finish shows some crisp, lemony acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sole dei Padri is a soft, opulent and elegant wine that would taste great with a sophisticated dinner of red meat and wild mushrooms. Aromas include black cherries, spice, smoked ham and white pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with a savory earth tone and drying layers of crushed stone and wet granite. There are also pretty aromas of violets and pressed blue flowers. It finishes with fine tannins and a slightly gritty texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and flashy, this Cabernet is a bit rustic now. The vineyard is quite high up in the Mayacamas Mountains, and the flavors show that intense, mountain concentration of blackberries and cherries.

This is a deep, generous, modern Rioja with tons of ripeness but also ideal balance. Black-fruit flavors spread from cheek to cheek, while toast, bitter chocolate and espresso notes add complexity. This beauty finishes stout, with toast, mint, chocolate and herb flavors. Drink from 2015 through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opulent, ripe wine comes from a single vineyard.

A soft, tart expression of the variety, it offers bittersweet tannin and dark cherry at its core.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bit hot and heavy. Alcohol gives it a glyceriney sweetness, while the flavors themselves are very ripe in blackberry and cherry pie filling, with a superripe finish of prunes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggest coffee, vanilla, oak, savory herb and menthol.

It has great potential with delicious acidity at the same time as depth of flavor complexity. This is a wine for the long-term, so give it at least seven years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There's something enormously satisfying about this Merlot-based blend. It hits the Napa-Bordeaux sweet spot, with concentrated blackberry and cherry fruit, jacketed in sweet, smoky oak. But there's also a fascinating olive character. The tannins are rich and dense and velvety. Great to experience now, and should be one for the long haul, perhaps through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A fine, mineral, structured wine with a very dry, solid core. Juicy red fruits offer a hint for its future ripeness. It has the freshness of the vintage that shows through at the end of this chunky wine.

Right now it's fierce in tannins and acidity, making it tough and resistant in feeling. Give it several hours in a decanter before serving, or else hold it for 4-5 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very ripe and fruity, this has a rich, glycerine-driven sweetness, like a tangy ruby Port. It's delicious in blackberry jam and caramel flavors, with intricate tannins and fine, citrusy acids.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tough and gritty in tannins, this Cabernet is still raw. There's a flattering core of ripe blackberry and black currant fruits, but the wine doesn't show the approachability of other 2007 Cabernets. Give it another five years in the cellar, but no guarantees that the fruit will outlast the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tart now, with lots of acidity cutting across the blackberry and mineral flavors. As rich as it is, there's a taut elegance that makes the wine tense. Clearly too young, it should develop fine bottle complexity over this decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A flashy, opulent Cabernet. You could even call it sexy. It's so soft and luxurious in blackberry, blueberry and cassis flavors. Absolutely delicious by any standard, yet the dry structure maintains elegant balance. Drink soon for youthful drama.

Oaky aromas of root beer and blackberry are smooth and heady. This wine is intense, with big tannins and firm acidity. Faith will be rewarded down the line with potent berry and chocolaty oak flavors.

A handful of S\\u00c3\\u00a9millon is blended in, adding extra oomph and flavor, the finish balanced in acidity and marked by freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with 6% Marsanne, the aromas are light (considering the appellation and producer), bringing notes of herb, smoked meat, white pepper, mineral and earth. The flavors are tart and bright, creating a real sense of freshness and vibrancy.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cesari hits all the right marks with this single-vineyard wine and presents a gorgeous, proudly modern wine with soft plush notes of chocolate, vanilla coffee, smoked ham and natural rubber. It is chewy and firm in the mouth but ends on a fresh note, leaving the palate glossed and clean.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: They kept this Cab back all this time, presumably at some cost to the company, but consumers are the beneficiaries.

Chewy, firm and succulent, it's a mouth-watering bruiser that leaves a lasting imprint on the palate. Only 60 cases made.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the first Pinot from the Napa house of Pahlmeyer, the result of many years of effort in his vineyard in the Fort Ross area of the true Sonoma Coast. The result is rich in cherry pie, raspberry liqueur, cotton candy, licorice, vanilla and cinnamon flavors that captivate from sip one, but there's a certain young vine simple directness that limits the score. As the vines age, the wine is one to watch.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The Sartori family is behind this wonderful vineyard select wine with deep concentration and intense aromatic of savory plum, cherry, natural rubber, almond nut and mineral shadings. The wine is well-rounded in the mouth with fresh acidity at the back and dusty mineral flavors on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: 75% Syrah and 25% Cinsault from the oldest continually cultivated vinifera vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. The spicy, intensely aromatic nose mixes black cherry, concentrated cassis, coffee, bacon, leather and roasted nuts. It unfolds in layer upon layer of rich fruit, tannin, leather and smoke. Dense, deep and Rh\\u00c3\\u00b4ne-like, it finishes with a montage of meaty, peppery, bacon-smoke flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very light mango, pineapple and banana aromas are joined by flowers and minerals. Nutty notes are brought to the fore on the dry and stony palate. Finishes broad and long, with echos of the floral and mineral notes on the nose. Now it's pretty tight; best in 2002 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gary Figgins works his usual magic and adds layers of rich, buttery, nutty oak to the light, pleasant Sangiovese fruit. The oak doesn't overwhelm, it underscores, and the effect is exciting, sensuous and fat. The wine floats across the palate, with light fruit and buttery oak melding into a sinuous, delicious whole. Beautiful winemaking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This patiently aged wine delivers a dynamic and rich nose with aromas of plums, cassis, cola, Dr Pepper, chocolate syrup and well-spiced German chocolate cake. Those ripe elements are tamed on the tart and lively palate that shows sour plum skins alongside star anise, beef blood and dank herbs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Floral and lush, this majority Cabernet Sauvignon contains 10% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot, combining for a structured, layered wine accented in black cherry, cedar and dried herb. From vineyards strewn across the Napa Valley, including mountainside sites, it offers power and finesse and should sit well in cellar through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy and big-bodied, this is a balanced expression of earthy black cherry and well-honed structure. Soft and lush on the palate, it'll appeal to fans who like a bit more meat on their Pinot bones, yet appreciate the fine texture of the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Malbec from high-elevation vines, this wine is medium in weight and texture, and bright in light, red fruit. The tannins are subtle upon entry, building softness and power in the glass, taking on weight amid gamy layers of black pepper and blueberry on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pretty aromas convey rose, wild red berry, savory herb and a hint of baking spice. The palate opens with wild cherry, black raspberry, clove and sage but drops off quickly on the midpalate. It's already accessible, with fine-grained tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 53% Zinfandel, 26% Petite Sirah and 21% Syrah shows grape candy and roasted beef crust on the nose.

The funky note carries over to the palate along with dried plum and white pepper. Youthfully austere tannins provide the backbone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This youthful wine shows the exuberance of tannin and power of the vintage, finding its time to unwind. Small percentages of Merlot and Petit Verdot figure in the blend. Oak, cedar and herb jump out most, with faint layers of blackberry and black cherry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lifted peach and wilting petals of Damask rose unite in the perfumed, supremely aromatic nose of this wine. The palate continues with rosewater notes of Turkish Delight and candied peach. Honeyed and rich, the sweet palate is concentrated but guided by lemony freshness. Overwhelming with perfume and concentration, this decadent wine needs either a perfumed, peachy dessert or a salty blue cheese to match those crashing waves of full-blown flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon comprises 95% of the blend, along with 5% Merlot. Sourced from the Beckstoffer Georges III vineyard, this wine shows the enormous ripeness and softness that vineyard is known for, with rich, opulent black cherry jam and mocha flavors, balanced by acidity and tannins.

Aged in 35% new French oak, the wine seems to build and intensify on the palate and linger on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of tropical fruit, spring flowers and white peach lead the nose on this single-vineyard bottling. The rich palate doles out green apple, ripe pear and candied citrus zest alongside racy acidity and a foaming mousse.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Wood aging does not help the richness of this wine. It brings out toast and covers the glorious sweet fruits. With acidity thrown in the balance is not there. Maybe several years will help, so don't drink before 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Softened by the addition of 13% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, this wine leads with smoky oak and baked bread aromas, followed by cassis and mocha notes. Medium bodied, with a seamless texture, it adds baked cherry, cedar and tomato leaf components with measured richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: 92\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009394. Barrel sample. Wood and mint aromas yield a wine that is darkly tannic, with a distinct black-coffee flavor. It's a powerful, concentrated wine with fruit hiding behind the dense structure.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine is soft and fruity with ripe berry fruits and gentle tannins. For a major second wine, it's surprisingly easy and soft, developing fast with its berry fruits, chocolate and wood flavors at the end.

The tight palate delivers clove, ground white pepper, grilled herb and dried black cherry alongside bracing tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leather, toasted oak, dried red fruit and plum cake lead the nose on this hearty Brunello.

You'll also detect the heat of alcohol on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 85% Carignano, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, this open with aromas of black-skinned berry, cedar and oak. The soft, round palate offers fleshy black cherry, black currant, licorice and ground pepper alongside soft acidity and smooth, silky tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% varietal wine is dark and foreboding in brambly blackberry and dense, smooth layers of textured oak and vanilla. Beyond full bodied, it holds on to enough acidity to make it complex and age-worthy, finishing in a splash of toffee and caramel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, bold wine with a wild, slightly earthy and herbal character in the otherwise ripe blackberry and spicy pepper aromas and flavors. The texture is quite thick with tannins, and the body is full. It comes from the windy and cool Jameson Canyon corner of Napa Valley.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous wine with loads of intensity and personality derived from the native Corvina grape of Valpolicella, Italy. It's amazingly rich and smooth with long-lasting flavors of maraschino cherry, Indian spice and cola.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A super-rich wine, packed with peach and green plum fruits, layers of wood and an intense concentration. An impressive wine that shows weight and richness as well as style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine tastes and feels important. It has great weight and depth. The tannins are extraordinarily thick, but ripe and smoothly sweet. And then there's the fruit, a detonation of blackberries, cherries, blueberries and cassis, not to mention the oak, which seems as fine as oak gets. This superb wine seems like an obvious cellar candidate. It should ride out the decade effortlessly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An appropriately rich wine, full, toasty and dense. The fruit is beautifully balanced with ripe acidity, just a touch of spice, citrus and an opulent, full-bodied character. It will certainly age, but is already very drinkable.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A pure expression of Chardonnay, this luminous sparkling wine offers a generous nose with warming tones of yellow rose, apricot, almond paste, baked bread and vanilla cream. The wine spreads smoothly over the palate with a remarkably soft and velvety feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dryness and tannins mark this Cabernet, giving it some austerity and astringency. But lurking deep below the surface is a vast underground landscape of blackberry fruit, cassis, plums, olives, herbs and oak. Fascinating and intricate and a little heady, but undrinkable now due to immaturity. Needs 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years to show its stuff.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of fresh, zingy acidity in this dry, young Chardonnay, and the steely minerality gives it a tang of cold metal. There are tantalizing hints of ripe citrus fruit and apricots.

It shows a massive core of blackberries, currants, dark baker's chocolate and smoky oak, and the balance of acidity makes it clean and bright. All indications are of a cellarworthy wine. Drink 2014 and beyond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo shows funky aromas of rubber and animal\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094common for the scorching 2009 vintage in this area. Despite its core of dark cherry fruit, this is very astringent and brutally tannic, with a short finish. Don't think this will evolve well.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggesting ripe plum, exotic spice, blue flower and a whiff of pipe tobacco take shape in the glass. The full-bodied palate doles out ripe black cherry, raspberry, vanilla and a hint of star anise while velvety tannins give it a polished feel. An espresso note signals the close.

A coffee note wraps up the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A fine blend of ripe fruit and crisp red berry flavors, this negociant wine produced by Domaine Dujac is structured and generous. The bright acidity reflects the vintage while the structure and tannins reflect the appellation. Together, they will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich in rose scents, this is an extremely light, crisply textured wine, with subtle pomegranate, tart cherry and orange flavors. Silky and delicate, it offers a wealth of acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Compared to the excellent 2006, this wine is heavier, riper and jammier at every check point. The nose is baked and raisiny, while the palate feels saturated to the extreme and gritty as well. The primary flavors run toward baked plum and blackberry, while licorice, leather and raisin notes carry the finish. Give this lots of air after opening, about an hour or so.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, round and concentrated, this is developing fast. The acidity is already comfortably embedded in the ripe red-berry fruit..\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 17.5% alcohol is a bit much, but the burning effect is dampened by the mouthfeel's extraordinary thickness and richness.

The bright fruit gives the wine support and endurance, which is further reinforced by the soft, velvety mouthfeel\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Concentrated and complex, this has structure and acidity, with a black cherry flavor. It's a ripe, powerful wine that could become more generous as it ages.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows the richness of the vintage in its ripe red fruits. It has weight as well as tannins, with a solid, firmly structured base of red plum fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows sweet, plush fruit aromas, with background tones of leather and tobacco. By no means is this wine over the top, in fact, it shows a firm but elegant quality throughout.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: For a Premier Cru, this is surprisingly open and ready. It has a light structure, offering delicious, forward, juicy fruit that has been rounded out by wood aging. With its ripe character, it will be ready to drink in a year.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Quite a bit lighter in body than MacPhail's other single-vineyard '06s, this one benefits from the elegant structure. With its silky angularity, it offers complex flavors of cherries, raspberries, orange tea, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves and vanilla-rich new oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Although there's a lot of ripe blackberry jam, black currant and chocolate flavors, it's a little on the simple side. Ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage of Barolo Riserva San Bernardo (a wine that consistently scores in the 90-point range) appears much grittier and more oak-driven than past expressions.

Drink after 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made solely with Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of roasted coffee beans, toasted oak and blackberry jam.

The aromas here are thick and penetrating with tones of dried fruit, cherry preserves, cola and resin. The mouthfeel is deep and concentrated and the finish is impressively long. A true classic.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Expensive, but a perfect Pinot Noir to drink now for sheer luxury and decadence.

Now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a deeply ripe, authoritatively structured Syrah of great power and finesse. It's drinkable now for the velvety texture and massive flavors of grilled blackberries, blueberries, currants, dark unsweetened chocolate, leather, black pepper and lots of sweet, smoky new oak. But it's also fairly tannic. Very fine now, with a brief decant, and through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Titus's regular '06 Cab is a wonderful wine. Their Reserve is even better, showing a more dramatic structure of smooth, complex tannins and a more intense, fruity profile.

Delicious now and through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and simply rendered, this blends 50% Cabernet Franc, 40% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, all organically farmed in St. Helena. Cherry, plum and vanilla stand out amidst a medium-bodied undercurrent of milk chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very dark in color, dense and thick in the mouth, and tight in astringent tannins. Clearly an immature wine not showing well. The blackberry and cherry flavors are impressive, but the wine seems disjointed. Cellaring is a gamble.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A controversial wine, tasted twice. It's soft and tannic, with candied cherry-berry, mocha and sweet oak flavors. Seems at once dull and powerful. Hard to know where it's going, but the benefit of the doubt suggests 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There are very ripe aromas of kirsch, cassis, licorice and root beer on the nose of this bottling, which begin to evolve into prunes, dried figs and raisins with time. The cola spice flavor is strong as are the prune and milk chocolate, all of which ride a strong tannic frame.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bittersweet at first, with sizable tannins, this Cab also contains 13.8% Petit Verdot. Red and black berries give it a juicy palate atop dusty, chalky tannins and a richness of leather and clove on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This grippy Cab exhibits the power of the 10% Petit Verdot in the blend, softened by 6% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Cassis and raspberry provide a fruity core around lush, tight tannins and a black pepper-seasoned finish. Full bodied, it remains elegant in the glass.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of French oak, coconut, vanilla and spiced plum lead the nose on this powerfully structured wine. The oak sensations carry over to the warm palate along with cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and menthol. Bracing, close-grained tannins provide the framework and need time to unwind. Best after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the producer's monumental Atlas Peak vineyard, this is a tightly wound, solidly constructed mountain Cab, blended with a handful of Petit Verdot. Tobacco, black tea and a sliver of coconut intermingle around a medium-bodied whole that will benefit from cellaring, through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of leafy underbrush, mature berry, chopped herb and mocha lead the nose. The firm, full-bodied palate offers black cherry, licorice, menthol and clove alongside polished, fine-grained tannins. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Jammy, mature notes of dark cherry and blackberry preserves open the nose of this richly opulent Brunello. Background tones include polished mineral and sweet Christmas spice with lingering accents of black pepper and crushed clove.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Buoyant cola and root beer aromas frame solid aromas of almond paste and wild berry. This Brunello shows a smooth, rich mouthfeel with tight, compact tannins on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Altesino's Brunello is characterized by fine tannins, good acidity and aromas of white cherry, forest floor and bramble. The wine seems less intense than past vintages and there's a slightly browning edge to its color.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Makes for nice drinking right now, because of the abundance of forward, jammy blackberry and cherry fruit. On the other hand, the tannins are considerable, and the acidity is evident, so it could age over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fine and elegant Brunello is accented by plush softness and bright flavors of wild berry, raspberry and sweet almond paste. Thicker tones of espresso and chocolate appear on the close and are carried forth by the wine's velvety richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Round and velvety, it has aromas of ripe berry, chocolate and exotic spices. The rich palate delivers juicy black cherry punctuated with ground black pepper, cinnamon, carob, pipe tobacco and mint. Forward and sweet, this is already extremely accessible so enjoy soon. Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Syrah, this concentrated wine delivers plum, black pepper, cocoa, coffee, fleshy black cherry and notes of bay leaf. It's plush, soft and savory but it also seems shy on vibrancy and essential energy. Drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine, from perhaps Montalcino's most famous single vineyard, opens with fruit aromas of black plum, black berries, cake spices and a whiff of new leather. The ripe, round palate delivers sweet black cherry layered with notes of chocolate and hints of vanilla alongside friendly tannins. While it lacks its usual complexity, it's juicy, delicious and extremely accessible. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A solid effort, dry, tannic and rich in fruit. It's succulent in blackberries, black currants, cr\\u00c3\\u00aame de cassis, dark chocolate and plums, with an overlay of toasty oak. It shows the modern, fruit-forward Napa style.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hard tannins make this wine difficult to approach now, as they usually do for young Duckhorn Cabs. But it's quite a success for the chilly 2010 vintage, showing lush blackberry and cherry fruits and fine acidity. As tough as the tannins are, they're well structured, a strong suggestion that the wine, which includes Merlot, should have an easy time aging.  Start drinking it in 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cab, ripe as it is in cherries, black currants and dark chocolate, nonetheless is too soft in structure. It has a melted mouthfeel. The finish suggests caramelized wood. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an enormous wine, maybe too much. With its layers of rich black fruits and dark tannins, it is a powerful, juicy, jammy and super-ripe wine. It all seems excessive and out of balance. It's fun for a moment, but not for drinking with food.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The palate is big and cushioned, but the flavors are green, stewy and herbal. With carob and some veggies on the finish, there isn't convincing ripeness to this wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plump black raspberry and blackberry notes mix with vanilla and baked licorice on the fruit-driven nose of this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Syrah. The tannic tension and strong acidity of the palate overwhelms the flavors at first, eventually revealing dark purple fruit and a vanilla-laced finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Built around a core of acidity, this wine conveys a preponderance of cedar and sage, seemingly influenced by a softer variety like Merlot, of which it has 12%. Plum and black currant provide the fruit component, before a sizably tannic finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Complex and fascinating aromas suggesting cranberry, cedar and mushroom get your attention right away. Next a tight, firmly tannic texture takes over and seems to hold on to the fruit flavors. The wine is light to medium in body, and seems likely to let its flavors out after 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mellow, rounded and ripe notes of fresh and baked apples promise a rich wine. The palate is more sprightly and lends plenty of gingery, peppery spice to all the abundant apple fruit. This is wired and lively, dry but very fruity and unusually spicy with a fine backbone of bright, lemony freshness. Drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich perfumes reach the nose: quince and baked apple give a seductive tone. The palate strikes with the same richness but is dry. There is concentration and earthy power against a backdrop of freshness and fruity charm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With time, fresh rose petals merge into heady Turkish delight notes on the nose. This is full-on Gewurztraminer with all the bells and whistles: utterly decadent rose water and honeysuckle notes are submerged in rich, indulgent sweetness. This is perfumed and full-on: a super-charged varietal expression with rich, powdery layers of rose, honey and caramel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truffle, dried herb, espresso, new leather and balsamic aromas come together on this along with a whiff of wood shop. The firm tightly knit palate shows cranberry, sour cherry, clove and thyme framed in assertive close-grained tannins that leave a rather raspy finish. Drink after 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy aromas of truffle, forest floor, used leather and a funky whiff of barnyard carry over to the firm palate along with ripe black cherry, clove and a hint of game. It's on the rustic side but full of personality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fleshy, full bodied and concentrated, this holds rich flavors of wild vanilla, pear and peach. Needing time to unravel, it shows its oak and power without regret.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of wines from different vineyards in Pouilly, this powerful wine is concentrated, with tight minerality that demands further aging. Rich and packed with apples and green plums, it is a beautiful wine that will age well. Drink from 2018 at the earliest.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, dried plum, resin, leather and a whiff of baking spice aromas slowly emerge in the glass. The big chewy palate shows juicy blackberry, ripe black cherry, tobacco and clove set against a backbone of firm velvety tannins. Despite its heft, it also boasts surprising finesse. Hold for even more complexity. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The lilac, charcuterie, peat, smoke and black and green-olive aromas are tightly wound. The palate is focused, flavorful and energetic, showing depth and intensity while remaining quite light on its feet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas pop with notes of funk, smoked meat, red fruit, flowers, stems and orange peel. It's compact out of the gate with concentrated, tightly wound, salty flavors of olive brine, crushed rock and violets. It shows an exquisite sense of balance and a crazy long finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rich textured wine from the center of this Premier Cru. It has structure and concentration as well as generous white stone fruits. Densely packed with acidity, toast and a fine, creamy texture, the wine is likely to age well. It is produced from biodynamically grown grapes (as are all the Olivier Leflaive family Grand and Premier Crus). Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a domaine wine, coming from one of the vineyards owned by Olivier Leflaive and worked biodynamically. It is a very fine wine from probably the most well-known premier cru in the village. With its rich acidity and white fruits, it is generous as well as crisply textured. The toast from the wood aging adds its juicy character to this impressive wine. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Structured and still very young, this is a dense and fruity wine. The tannins and the spice and licorice from wood aging show strongly, although they are just beginning to soften and integrate. Expect a rich wine, layered with fruit and ripe tannins as it develops. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From old vines, as are most of the wines from this producer, this is a dense and powerful wine. New wood aging has given the wine a strongly toasty character balanced with creamy apple and yellow fruits. The wine is concentrated and obviously needs to age. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark in color, this wine offers reserved aromas of smoke, tobacco, red fruit, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis, flowers, exotic spice and funk. The palate is plush and forward but still light on its feet, showing energy and focus. Fruit and savory flavors persist on the finish, demonstrating exquisite balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From right at the northern end of the sweep of Corton Grand Cru vineyards, this rich and complex wine is dense with smoky flavors as well as ripe blackberry fruit. It is solid, densely structured and powered minerality from the chalk in the soil. This is going to be a fine wine, so drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This Premier Cru abuts some of the grandest Grand Crus of Burgundy. It shares the same rich, age-worthy characters with this dark structure and dense tannins. The wine is still very young: its texture mineral and concentrated. The black fruits and licorice flavors will develop slowly and surely, but don't drink before 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of the best barrels from the five Mercurey Premier Crus owned by the Devillard family. First produced in the 2010 vintage, the wine is now made in most vintages. It is a rich wine, bringing out the pure red fruitiness of a Mercurey and its beautifully integrated structure. It is concentrated and very dense, packed with vanilla, mint and dark coffee flavors as well as the fruit. Age this wine, at least until 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ground violets, charcoal, smoke, iron, black fruit, tar and salami lead a salty, briny, expressive palate that shows depth concentration and elegance. A long finish caps it off.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: So rich and ripe in fruit, you almost don't notice that it's also a complicated and layered wine in structure. Blackberry marmalade, cassis and cocoa flavors are balanced despite hefty alcohol. An extraordinarily delicious wine, but it's meant to be enjoyed in its youth. Drink up by 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A vastly concentrated Cabernet. Frazier seems to have taken their basic Cabernet, which is an excellent wine, and intensified everything about it. With explosive blackberry, cassis, blueberry, dark chocolate and oak flavors, it's almost too much of a good thing. Your best bet is to cellar it, but that's chancy. The alcohol is very high, and we do not know how these modern Cabernets will ride out the years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The majority Cab Sauvignon in the blend brings classic blackberry and cassis flavors, as well as firm tannins. The flavors are complex and interesting, and change as they breathe in the glass. Should develop additional bottle complexity over the years, although it's ready to drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Round and opulent, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc opens with aromas of black currants, blue flower, mocha and baking spices. The warm, dense palate delivers mouthfuls of succulent black cherry layered with chocolate, black pepper and clove alongside big, velvety tannins. Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This elegant Terzetto is equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot from the Chiles Valley District on the far eastern side of Napa Valley. The grapes are grown organically by the Eisele family, who have farmed these parts for 40 years. Dusty red fruit entice from the beginning, unveiling a soft, round and drinkable wine with the structure to age until 2024\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Rich and juicy, this features a ripe plum flavor and acidity, resulting in a wine that is fragrant, fresh and structured. It has power, and its dark concentration is at the heart of this solid effort.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This age-worthy wine was given plenty of time to develop in used French oak, and will stand up to further time in the cellar. Right now it offers structured depths of high-toned cherry and leather, with a floral flourish that keeps it bright and fresh despite its substantial concentration. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This majority Merlot, with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, is elegant in sandalwood and cedar, offering a taste of cassis and dried herb atop integrated yet sizable tannins. French oak, half of it new, encased the wine for a little more than two years, adding to its power and structure. Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aged in barrel for close to two years, this 100% varietal wine from a classic Napa Valley producer delivers a compelling mix of blackberry pie and chocolate. The flavors form around soft, silky, well-integrated oak and fine-grained tannins. Rich and robust, it discloses an elegance that suggests further cellaring, through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The scents of chaparral consume the nose of this rather high-alcohol wine, with crushed anise, dew-soaked sage, chemise and wild mint aromas spicing up a leathery boysenberry base. Rich flavors of black cherry extract, black cloves and vanilla decorate a grippy, mouth-tingling palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From an ocean-view vineyard with consistently exceptional fruit, this wine represents its provenance with class and elegance, delivering crisp cranberry and cherry around an ethereal earthiness and deft seasoning of herb. Aged in barrels previously used for Chardonnay from the same vineyard, it offers restrained oak that still provides structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of dark-skinned fruit, toast, mint and a whiff of espresso lead the nose on this Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc blend. The straightforward palate is on the lean side, offering raw red currant, coffee and star anise alongside firm acidity. Close-grained tannins leave a drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with delicate aromas of cassis, tobacco and cedar. The robust palate delivers mature plum, clove and espresso alongside chewy tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 24% Cabernet Franc, 22% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Petit Verdot, 14% Sangiovese, 6% Alicante and 5% Syrah, this opens with subdued aromas suggesting ripe black-skinned fruit, toast and coffee. The palate offers black cherry jam, espresso and oak-driven spice alongside polished tannins. It's a bit shy on freshness, so drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 60% Sangiovese and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has aromas of leafy underbrush, bell pepper, dried herb and black currant. The palate is rather austere, offering dried cherry, leather, licorice and powdered sage alongside tightly wound, grainy tannins that grip the finish. Let the tannins unwind for another year or two, then drink up to catch the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made in collaboration between Frescobaldi and prisoners of the Gorgona penal colony, this offers delicate aromas of ripe orchard fruit, white flower and a whiff of Mediterranean scrub. The round palate offers dried apricot and citrus before a savory finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The high acidity on this wine gives it a sharp and steely personality, especially on first impression. Those sharp edges will soften with time but the wine already shows slightly aged aromas of candied berries, tar, tobacco and leather. Pair it with creamy pasta dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From 1995, the vecchia annata (old vintage) referred to in the wine's name, this Sangiovese-based wine shows dried fruit aromas of prune and dried currant backed by licorice, tar and cola. The wine shows nicely aged aromas with some sour cherry and fine, polished tannins on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A creamy, wood-aged white that simultaneously emphasizes crisp Sauvignon Blanc fruit and minerality. Hints of pineapple and lemon go with a tight texture. A rich yet fresh wine that could age for a few years but can also be enjoyed now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tough in tannins, but rich in black currant flavor, this 100% Cab has some elegant features in its purity of structure and dryness. Let it air in the glass for 30 minutes or so before drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by exceptionally rich, fruity flavors that finish candy sweet, this Merlot-based blend has cherry jam, blackberry, mocha and spice flavors and soft tannins. Drink it over the next 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is tangy and zesty, with a strong mineral texture that partners with the perfumed acidity, lively fruitiness and citrus flavors. It is likely to age well because of its tight texture. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Perfumed spice aromas give this wine its toasty character. The wood aging dominates the fruit. The fruit is ripe and will develop. Give this wine until 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wood aromas provide a toasty character that dominates the fruit. It will take time for the apple and pear fruit flavors to show. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A mature nose of cornbread and oxidized fruits suggests a wine older than this. A white blend, it features a multitude of grapes led by Viura. On the palate, acidity is the key ingredient, while a mix of oxidized apple, melon and corn flavors runs long on the finish. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This well-made full-bodied wine exudes a juicy core of red currant, cranberry and vanilla as a persistence of tannin provides power and wooded support. Oak and cedar play nicely together and add a wealth of savory concentration.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This still-young wine is jammy while firmly structured with dry tannins. There is a foursquare character that misses subtlety with its broad-brush approach. The wine does need to age and will be ready to drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is another of the producer's intellectual exercises in experimental winemaking, made in tiny case-production numbers. It offers so much to think about, from its lemony-crisp and tangy palate to its chalky tannins. Full bodied, it merits attention, veering from herbal to chocolaty in one sip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa Valley, 10% Cabernet from Sonoma County's Monte Rosso Vineyard and 10% Petit Verdot from Napa, this wine reflects the cool vintage. It offers herb, cedar and peppercorn on the nose along with plenty of acidity and structure. The fruit tends red in cassis and cranberry, finishing juicy.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A blend of 97% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot, this wine speaks to power, offering juicy, velvety texture around brawny components of leather, coffee and black plum. Concentrated and intense, it needs time to open in the glass before pairing with thick cuts of meat.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of crushed blue flower, perfumed berry, exotic spice and a whiff of charcuterie emerge on this bold red. The concentrated palate offers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, licorice and ground pepper accompanied by firm, fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From estate grapes aged nine months in 100% new French oak, this features toasted wood that speaks in hushed undertones beneath a wealth of tangy stone fruit, baked pear and pineapple. Enjoyable now, it has a voluptuous richness on the midpalate that meets more nuanced acidity as it washes down.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Kirsch, wet stone, lavender and dried herb aromas are followed by ripe jazzy generous dark-fruit flavors. Fine-grained tannins provide support, with a supple mouthfeel piquing the interest.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a bold, brawny red from a famous site, velvety in texture and all power and concentration. Forest floor and a touch of smoke complement juicy dark cherry, caramelized oak and licorice, while bright acidity supports the layers of flavor and strong tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark blackberry, blueberry and blackcurrant fruits make for a ripe but extremely enticing nose on this bottling, lifted by aromas of vanilla, cola, clove and anise. The palate is delicious and rich with black cherry, but a zesty, bright acidity and chalky tannins contribute depth and length, with a touch of dill.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A unique blend of equal parts Petite Sirah and Merlot, with a smaller percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a sizably robust and dry, full-bodied wine. Puckering tannins should settle down in time, allowing the blackberry and black currant that's in there to shine through.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a notoriously tough vintage for the region, this wine shows gravel, turned earth, black olive, char and a bit of blackberry ripeness. It's lean on the palate, with flavors of tobacco, rustic elderberry and charred meats, exhibiting tannins that still need some chilling out.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot form a rich thick character for this red wine, that's lush and concentrated on the palate. Full-bodied ripeness features black-cherry pie in a graham cracker crust.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sweet tobacco and overripe cherry open the nose of this thick, jammy Amarone. The wine exhibits a syrupy, bold mouthfeel with lingering tones of smoke, beef jerky and spice on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is an extraordinarily rich Amarone that exudes blackness and dense aromas of cola, raisins, dried prunes, leather, tobacco, spice and cherry wood. It's a big wine for big meals of succulent grilled meats or heavy winter stews. Vanilla and soft oak flavors come though and the mouthfeel is round and velvety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Amarone is made in a traditional style with aromas of forest berry, red apple, spice and barbecue smoke. It exhibits pretty luminosity and buoyancy with vibrant fruit flavors and a fresh cherry finale. Very nice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the beautiful Calderara Sottana cru, this elegant wine packs a powerful aromatic punch of Spanish cedar, black fruit and volcanic smoke. There's harmony here: a tight, gritty texture and long-lasting intensity on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An attractive, upscale Pinot for drinking over the next six years. It's dry and silky, with a nice tension of acidity and fruit. Shows flavors of red cherry pie filling, cola, mocha, anise, cinnamon, pepper and smoky oak. Beautiful and complex.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe and crisp and rich, in the manner of this fine vintage, offering an explosion of cherries, currants, anise and vanilla-scented cedar. With its silky texture, it's a beauty, but needs time. Give it 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in the modern style, this Cab is soft and creamy in the mouth, and fantastically rich. It oozes ripe, crushed blackberries, black currants and dark unsweetened chocolate, with the sweetness coming from natural fruit and caramelized oak. The tannins are as soft and complex as they come.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This top-end Cabernet from the dynamic Moletto estate delivers impressive intensity and extremely attractive notes of black fruit, toasted spice and black stone. The nose is slightly sweet smelling and the mouthfeel is modern, penetrating, plush and velvety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very light in color, this wine brings appealing aromas of white pepper, smoked meat, orange peel, herb, earth and sauvage. The palate is ethereally light and delicate, showing pleasing nuances, with plenty of floral flavors on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas suggesting mature dark-skinned berry, violet, tobacco and an earthy whiff of game on this. The aromas carry over to the full-bodied palate, together with hints of dark spice and dried cherry. Chewy tannins provide support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Mike Mooney adds complexity with 16% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot on this bottling, which shows blueberries, crushed black rocks and dark chocolate on the nose, but doesn't offer a lot of Cab Francness. The palate does offer some, however, with grippy tannins and dried oregano touches laid across rich black cherry, blueberry, fudge and espresso notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With some firm structure behind the red fruits, this wine will have a good future. A dry core sustained by the acidity is waiting to burst out and give a ripe, fruity while always fresh wine. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Syrah, this has aromas of mature black-skinned fruit, French oak, leather and cedar. The full-bodied palate offers cured meat, dried blackberry, ground pepper and anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mature black-skinned fruit, new leather, Mediterranean herb and dark spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this big, bold red. The brawny monolithic palate doles out ripe plum, black cherry marinated in spirits and cake spice alongside chewy tannins and the warmth of evident alcohol. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a clear, light wine, aged lightly in oak, only 30% of it new. Wild brush and burnt orange dominate in taste and aroma, with additional characteristics of rhubarb, red cherry and lovely rose.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This luscious blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese shows bright cherry and blueberry characteristics backed by smooth richness and velvety texture. The wine is soft, dense and delicious overall. It presents a beautiful portrait of Tuscan wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Somewhere between the acidity and dryness, this Pinot has a terrifically interesting core. It's a subtle wine, now suggesting cherry fruit, now retreating in favor of earthier mushrooms, minerals and pine needles, framed in firm tannins. Strikes out new territory for cool-climate Pinot Noir, less ripe, lower in alcohol and more exciting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy and deep as midnight, with spice, floral notes, herbal aromas, tobacco and mocha. The palate is super rich, almost to the point of syrupy, with blackberry, brown sugar and coffee flavors. Finishes chewy, ripe and deep, with no harshness or tannic grind. Drink now through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Summus is a beautiful Tuscan blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah that opens with a drying, dusty mineral feel followed by loads of plump, ripe fruit. Great care was executed in the clonal selection of Sangiovese and that variety delivers the wine's distinctive territoriality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a best of barrels blend from Hall's various vineyards, including the famous Sacrashe. The wine itself is lovely. It has a firm structure thanks to dusty tannins and a dry minerality, while bright acidity makes the cherry, blackberry, blueberry, cassis and dark chocolate fruit sing. Drink now and through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the third release of Figgins, a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins from his Figgins Estate vineyard. Intensely aromatic, it explodes from the glass with baking spices and deep cassis fruit. Over the course of three days it opened into a sleek, stylish, complex mix of purple- and black-berries, dried herbs, bark, dusty cocoa and a streak of caramel. Long and lush, it's a wine to cellar for a decade or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A new bottling from the winery. The vineyard is in the Petaluma Gap, a cool area south of the Russian River Valley, toward San Francisco. The vintage was cool, too, so the wine is brisk in acidity and low in alcohol, but it still tastes amazingly ripe and complex. The wine dazzles with waves of black raspberry jam, sweet olive tapenade, saut\\u00c3\\u00a9ed brown mushroom, root beer, moo-shu plum sauce and mocha. If those flavors sound like they don't go together, just try the wine. It's seamless and compelling. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a heavy-duty Cabernet, big in every way, with rich black cherry and cassis fruit, and dense, dark tannins. The long, slightly grainy finish reinforces the impression of raw power, yet the wine retains perfect proportion and is nicely differentiated from the other 2010s crafted by winemaker Chris Figgins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blends nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah with a quarter Malbec and smaller addition of Merlot. They get along nicely, offering a lush, full-bodied palate that remains balanced, showing an exuberance of succulent cherry, tobacco, graphite and meaty leather.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy rose petals and a stemmy tartness shine in this wine, sourced from the Bush Vineyard planted to the Calera clone. Vibrantly complex hits of cranberry and orange add spiciness atop a lithe texture, with the ripeness considerably subdued.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a beautifully cool coastal spot dotted in redwoods, this medium-bodied wine shows struggle in its tight layering of acidity and vibrantly fresh blueberry and black tea, Chewy in texture, still-resolving tannin and oak give way to a succulence that's just beginning to be revealed.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alpine herb, crushed stone, wild berry, pressed rose and a whiff of tar are some of the aromas you'll find on this wonderfully fragrant Nebbiolo.

With a backbone of cassis and vanilla, it's expansive and lengthy, velvety in texture and very satisfying.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the largest estates in Margaux, Lascombes is now performing well. With this vintage the heavy over-oaking of past years has gone to be replaced with a wine that is full of black fruits as much as rich tannins. There is concentration and a good potential for aging. Drink from 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard-designate opens in inviting, perfumed aromatics of apple blossom and honeysuckle. On the palate it reveals substantial depth and breadth, the oak characteristic quite caramelized.

The palate offers dark berry layered with oak sensations alongside astringent wood tannins. It has an excruciatingly dry finish. Superior Wines, Siema.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas recall nail polish remover, overripe fruit, oak vanilla and coffee. The palate offers black cherry mingled with vanilla, chocolate and sweet oak. However it lacks intensity and persistence and doesn't have an age-worthy structure. It closes on a drying, tannic note before trailing off.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A densely concentrated but unbalanced wine, it opens with aromas of stewed prunes, plum, oak, coconut and espresso. The heavy wood influence carries over to the palate. Black cherry notes are overwhelmed by oak, vanilla extract and coffee bean. Drying wood tannins dominate the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A fresh wine, with some of the richness of the vintage showing in up-front red berry fruits. The tannins are already well integrated, allowing the wine to show a softer side. It is for medium-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vintner Chiara Boschis took over this historic estate after the death of its founder Luigi Pira.

Not ready now, but should easily negotiate the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the darkest of Williams Selyem's new Pinots and also one of the ripest. It's jammy in the intensity of raspberry and cherry fruit, with a savory, Dr. Pepper cola richness. The spiciness, which is one of winemaker Bob Cabral's specialties in capturing, is exotic. It's a big, fat, rich wine that needs decanting now, and should age for 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another stellar El Puntido, this time with excellent concentration and full-load aromas of black fruit, leather, fine dried cheese and cola.

Delicate acidity and whisper-light tannins add to its plush feel.

It's lean, dry and robustly tannic.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firm and structured, this has strong tannins set over smoky fruit. It has concentration, although the wood flavor has an old-wood feel, seeming just a touch dirty.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The second vintage of this wine produced, this blend of Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre (53%), Syrah (33%) and Grenache shows aromas of red and black fruit along with barrel spices.

Drink starting from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of exotic spice, baked plum, leather and menthol lead the nose along with a whiff of crushed purple flower. The smooth hearty palate delivers mature blackberry, prune, cinnamon and pipe tobacco while velvety tannins provide seamless support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 100% varietal wine opens with alluring aromas of plum, clove, stems and spice. The purple-fruit flavors are palate coating, speckled with cocoa and barrel accents throughout.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, grilled porcini, chopped herb, tilled soil aromas and a hint of stewed fruit unfold in the glass. The developed palate doles out layers of mature black cherry, raspberry compote, chopped mint, tobacco and anise set along against a backbone of fine-grained tannins. It will be even better in a few years but it's not built for long-term cellaring.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of sunbaked earth, underbrush, grilled herb and mature black-skinned fruit lead the nose along with a whiff of worn leather.

Intensely flavored and oaked, it finishes unexpectedly herbal and dry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Syrah wine that's been aged seven years in French oak and fortified with four-year-old Charbay Syrah brandy, this vintage selection is aromatically stunning in chocolate, tobacco and dried ginger candy notes. Balanced and rich, it finishes semidry, with a viscous taste of almonds and dried cranberries, both of which would make a good pairing, atop a selection of gooey cheeses.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine of moderate build and mouth-coating concentration, this shows a dusty plume of tannin and plum and soy flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Norace is a blend of Cannonau, Syrah and Carignano that offers dried fruit and spice, backed by tobacco, black olive and a whiff of blue flower.

Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From four estate vineyards with an average vine age of 33 years, this sparkles in creamy texture and sophisticated, yummy flavors of tangerine, grapefruit and pear. Stony minerality plays on the palate throughout, buoying complex components of jasmine and a lingering, more concentrated finish of honey. With plenty of structure and stuffing, it'll only get better over time, through about 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The heavy bottle is quite unnecessary with this impressive wine that boasts its own richness and weight.

Maximum ripeness means it's a bit Port-like on the palate, with baked black-fruit flavors that finish soft and jammy. This brims with power, extraction and flavor but it's grasping for structure. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fully ripe, extracted fruit dominates in this robust, heady wine, a mixture of red berry jam and vanilla that takes on a perceptible sweetness on the palate. From the mighty mountain vineyard, it also shows dustings of dried herb and brush, an herbal undertone that balances its overall intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The flavors are ripe with blackberries and currants in this 100% Cab, and ample new French oak lends a fat, buttery, smoky richness. Yet there's a harsh, scoury mouthfeel that is pronounced. Rich grilled beef will help tame it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of ripe blackberry, currant, toasty oak and spice flavors shine in this dry, tannic young Cabernet. Small proportions of Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc add complexity to the blend.

Zesty acidity and whispers of pollen and earth lend a savory complexity that's beguiling, sip after sip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, scorched earth, menthol and ripe berry lead the nose. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, raspberry, grilled herb, anisette and white pepper alongside round tannins. Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: New oak dominates this wine, and the tannins, which are derived from both the wood and the grapes, give it an unrelieved astringency. Not showing much pleasure now, but there's a solid core of blackberries and black cherries. It's unclear if the fruit will outlast the tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While there are plenty of firm tannins and weight here, the wine does feel somewhat hollow. The red fruits are there, showing slowly against the tannins. It has fine final acidity, but not the power and concentration you should expect.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A classy Chardonnay for sipping now. Dry and zesty in acidity, it has appealing tangerine, Meyer lemon, white flower, honey and mineral flavors.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, scorched earth, leather and camphor aromas lead the way along with an earthy whiff of game.

Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Strongly wood-aged, this is a ripe, toasty wine. The citrus and creamed apple fruits are still working their way through the wood flavors. It's going to be richly fruity wine with a round texture that is cut by acidity. Give it time and drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is structured and concentrated, showing a strong sense of minerality. Citrus and ripe apple fruits are complemented by richer apricot, always cut through with acidity and a tense texture.

Earth, mushroom, blackberry and raw oak are all present on the bouquet. Flavors of blackberry and plum are ripe and rich, with an herbal hint. The finish is long, heady, heavy and tannic. Drink through 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is solidly built with tannin and oak, a searing earthiness dulling the fruit. Tar, earth and spicy cardamom aromas domainate its full-bodied concentration and youthful ripeness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the western edge of Sonoma Valley, this robust, full-figured wine took on considerable power in this vintage. It exhibits elusive fruit before peeling back bittersweet layers of cranberry, orange peel and tea. After fresh rose on the nose, it adds an element of char to the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Grand Cru Class\\u00c3\\u00a9, with its 25% Cabernet Franc, is rich and opulently textured. It brims with ripe berry fruits, plus dense tannins that are supple and well integrated. Still developing, it's full in the mouth and is becoming a generous wine, more fruit than long-term structure. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a finely etched wine with just the right balance between its ripe fruits and tannins.

Purple fruits dominate the palate, with complexity provided by creosote and violets, along with ample tannins and acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Caramel aromas lead to a wine that is soft, ripe and rich. It has sweetness, a generous texture and ripe spicy fruits. Tantalizing hints of honey go with the smooth yellow fruits and opulent character. It's still young for a wine of this stature, so drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas recall ripe berry and blue flower with a balsamic note.

Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This begins with a bucketload of dense and brooding aromas, from macerated plums and cherries to dark chocolate and melted black licorice sticks. It's soft and mouth-coating once sipped, with pronounced tannins on the midpalate, flavors of black cherry and olallieberry, a bit of tarry tension and minty sensation on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The tough and chewy tannins make this hard to appreciate now, despite its strong core of black cherry jam. Upon decanting, the structure softens slightly and more complex fruits, herbs and spices emerge.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a very good, reserved and light-bodied wine with mostly tangy citrus and a bit of riper apple flavor, but it's not at all oaky. It will make an excellent wine before or during a meal, and should be versatile in pairings.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine's oak, toasted nut and menthol aromas carry over to its evolved palate, along with a coffee note and bracing tannins. It's shy on fruit richness and intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine includes all five traditional red-Bordeaux varieties, Merlot the most dominant, resulting in tart Bing cherry and cassis flavors.

This is a rough wine with stampeding tannins. Toasty boysenberry flavors are more pounding than elegant, while this tastes of bitter chocolate on an aggressive finish. Give this five years and it may show better but now it's massive and unsettled.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a funky, leathery smell to this wine that's disturbing, and whatever is responsible is tamping down the flavors. It's muted in fruit, although the oak stands out. Okay with a good decant, but not going anywhere.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This somewhat flat, green and tannic wine is reduced and sour in tone, with medium body and broad acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful Cabernet, dry, smoothly tannic and impressive for its volume of flavor. Shows a complex range of blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak, with a long, spicy finish. Elegant and powerful at the same time, it should develop in the bottle over the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: One of the best wines made on the beautiful island of Sicily, Donnafugata's Mille e Una Notte exhibits gorgeous smoothness in the mouth and exceedingly rich aromas of black currants, chocolate, spice and tobacco. Under all that are notes of toasted almond and pistachio that are characteristic of the Nero d'Avola grape.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Just delicious, this wine shows its pedigree from some of the best vineyards in the valley, including Merryvale's St. Helena estate.

Great for drinking now with the best meats and cheeses you can find.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The best thing about this Chardonnay is the acidity. It's brisk and clean, and gives a zesty finish to the extraordinarily rich pineapple, papaya, lime and Meyer lemon flavors that are almost sweet, but aren't.

Shows power and smoky barbecue aromas of soy sauce, teriyaki, bresaola, cherry liqueur, rum cake, Spanish cedar and sticky pipe tobacco. Cured meat and savory spice as well. Seems extracted and overripe, with hard tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This interesting wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with a drop of Cabernet Sauvignon that seems to give it a bit of needed power. Still, it's soft and melted. While the currant, red stone fruit and licorice flavors are delicious and complex, it lacks structure. Drink up.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Cabernet Sauvignon-based wine is a blend of all the Bordeaux varieties, including Carmenere. It's soft, luscious and a little hot in alcohol, with very rich, almost overripe blackberry, dark chocolate and currant flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this seven year-old is showing some age.

Astringent tannins still need to integrate, but for now leave the mouth feeling dried out. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This retro-styled wine displays its new-wood influence.

Delivers a very firm, polished and linear feel in the mouth. Dusty aromas of crushed stone and crushed white pepper are backed by cola, cassis and red currant.

Very enduring and intense with tight, firm tannins and good length.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Inky, ripe, nicely extracted and loaded tight with blackberry, spice and cherry aromas, this is a beautiful Brunello that delivers intensity, staying power and promises easy food-pairing potential. Velvety, soft, rich and plush in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe fruit, prune, sticky pipe tobacco and rum cake notes are bold and big, with thick aromatic embroidery and broader brush strokes. Structured and incredibly smooth on the finish. This wine shows a fine, velvety texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello Riserva is defined by a layer of coffee and espresso that peels back nicely to reveal dark fruit, cassis, leather and tobacco. It's smooth, ripe, fresh and structured.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello opens with a sweet nose of bright cherry fruit, mocha and vanilla bean. The wine's flavors are more savory, with some background notes of forest floor and wild mushroom. The mouthfeel is firm and steady, but also fresh and compact.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is finely structured, with its ripe tannins forming a solid base for the dense red fruit and spicy wood flavors.

Age for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firm from the start, the wine then shows both ripe red-berry fruit and a dense structure. There's an herbal edge that will soften in the next 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years, bringing out the richness of Chambolle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This delivers textbook aromas of candied berry, tobacco, cured meat, teriyaki, cinnamon and Spanish cedar. There's a touch of heat on the finish that is cushioned by the wine's rich density and velvety mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is made in the style of the winery's marvelous Finch Hollow Chardonnays, but is just a little less concentrated. Dry, crisp and elegantly clean, it has complex, mineral-infused flavors of tangerines, peaches and limes, enhanced with lots of smoky new oak. It should hold in the bottle through 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An intense and fresh wine that is packed with acidity as well as powerful red fruits. It is breathtakingly fruity at this stage, the structure still developing and giving a delicious perfumed berry character. Drink from 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo shows roasted coffee notes and a whisper of prune, with lots of oak on top. It's very dry, tannic and tough on the palate. Still young, but it lacks fruit flavors and balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe notes of cherry, black fruit, dried apple skin and tobacco leaf appear on the nose of this Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc-Marzemino blend. The wine is chewy and dense in the mouth but there's a slightly bitter note on the close that comes as a surprise.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by sweet, jammy fruit and oak, this wine is quite good, but doesn't show much complexity. It's smooth and silky, with pie-filling flavors of blackberries, raspberries and cherries, wrapped into firm but fine tannins. Could develop bottle complexity down the road, but it's a gamble.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Fresh and juicy, with bright acidity and some solid tannins. Flavors of spice accompany an edge of green fruit. The aftertaste is tannins and wood.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of baked plum, coconut and roasted coffee bean lead the nose. The palate offers dried black cherry, vanilla, toast and a confectionary note alongside assertive but ripe tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Merlot (48%) blends with Cabernet Franc (40%) and Cabernet Sauvigon on this earth-laden wine. Aromas of funk, earth, peat, savory herbs and dark flowers lead to soft, sweet, smoky flavors. The texture and richness keep the interest high.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: As densely built as its name suggests, this wine is grippy with black fruit and robust tannin, its full-bodied concentration laced with integrated oak. Brooding blackberry and black cherry dominate the midpalate, with a one-two punch of chocolate and tobacco, finishing with clove and pepper spice.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This estate blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc, 26% Merlot and 2% Petit Verdot is smoky and tart. Its robust underbelly of tannin and persistent charred oak notes frame a core of red currant and cranberry fruit, peppered with clove.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vineyard designate from Yountville is packed with compact tannin and rich oak yet nicely balanced by crisp ranberry, cherry and clove flavors. Light black-pepper notes add seasoning.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello opens with a sweet nose of vanilla and cherry. The bouquet is straightforward, giving the wine a frank, no-nonsense personality. Flavors of spice, leather and tobacco appear later, rendering more depth. It feels youthful, soft and chewy on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An inky-black appearance and spicy-savory aromas make this the kind of Brunello you want to drink on a really cold winter night. Tightly concentrated and extracted, with loads of black cherry, leather and tobacco, there are balsam notes too, but delivered in a big, strong fashion. The smooth, silky finish that is not overly dense or intense.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard, which is in St. Helena, certainly yielded grapes that were ripe, to judge by this wine's flavors. It's gigantic in berries, cherries, mocha and spices that are jammy and sweet. The best thing about it are the tannins, which are smooth and complex. Give this flashy young Petite Sirah a couple years to integrate and mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nice ripeness, fullness and generosity here. The bouquet opens with bold brushstrokes that don't match the delicate, subdued feel in the mouth. It delivers most of its energy on the nose and segues to a much calmer, more straightforward style on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A firm, darkly structured wine. It has a hard edge of smoky wood tannins that dominate the black fruits, so it needs 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years to balance out. It's always likely to be a firm, dense wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by acidity, strong tannins and powerful fruit, this Cabernet is a three-way playoff. The fruit is the obvious early victor, flashy in plums, blackberries, cassis and cedar. But the astringency makes it difficult to enjoy now. Cellar for six years, and see what happens.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of vanilla, mocha, dried herbs, pencil lead and flowers rise up from the glass. Rich and hedonistic in style, it's full of concentrated cherry and coffee flavors that pack a hefty punch.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of blue flower, ripe woodland berry and a whiff of pressed powder.

Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with earthy aromas of tilled soil, leather, game, dark berry and graphite.

Drink from 2018\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon opens with aromas of blueberry and black plum accented with vanilla and coffee notes. Still tight, the palate offers up a core of rich black cherry accented with espresso, oak, vanilla and licorice alongside astringent, drying tannins. Give this a few years to unwind and fully develop.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Almost black in color, this stunning wine is gorgeous, rich and dense. It's grand and powerful, with a strong sense of its own importance. The beautiful tannins and the fragrant black currant fruits are palpable. It's a great wine, with huge potential.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: It takes only a few moments before you appreciate the enormity, intensity and overall beauty of this landmark wine. Cerretalto is always a high scoring expression of Brunello, but the ideal conditions of the 2007 vintage elevate it to earthly perfection. Dark and fleshy, the wine delivers ever-evolving aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, spice and tobacco. The acidity is carefully balanced against the wine's thickness and rich texture. The finish is long, luscious and elegant. Keep this bottle in your cellar 10 years or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is the finest Cheval Blanc for many years. It is, quite simply, magnificent. The wine shows the greatness of Cabernet Franc in the vintage, with 57% of the variety in the blend. It is beautifully structured and perfumed, with velvety tannins, balanced acidity and swathes of black-currant and black-cherry fruits. It's well on course to becoming a legendary wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A hugely powerful wine, full of dark, brooding tannins. It's a wine for seriously long-term aging, a sculptural vision of classic Bordeaux structure with with classy, ripe blackberry fruits. It has fresh acidity and an immense full-bodied character, cut through with mineral acidity. A great wine, with great potential.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an architectural wine, very classical in its structure like so many of the top wines of 2010. It's powered by ripe tannins and beautiful black currant fruits. While the wine is gorgeously ripe, it also has a powerful dark and structured character. For long-term aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A structured wine from the Chadronnier family, it is full of tannins and also full of sweeping black-fruit flavors. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated. Don't drink until at least 2020 to get the full generosity of the wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dense, baked, raisiny nose is ultra ripe but also a bit flabby and damp-smelling. A big, grabby mouth-filler, this offers baked, oaky flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate, finishing with lingering chocolate and prune. Drink this chunky, superripe Priorat sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Black plum and blueberry lead the nose on this fruit-forward wine, but there's a dark turned-earth component keeping it serious. Thick black fruit like elderberry ride a firm structure on the palate, where smoked beef, black-pepper spice and a vanilla finish combine for a solid bottling.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ser Gioveto is 80% Sangiovese with small additions of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. It has a deeply saturated ruby color and compelling aromas of ripe fruit, strawberry, rum cake and soft spice. There's a jammy accent in the bouquet that gives momentum to its rich, velvety mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A lovely Merlot, this is pure, vibrant and elegant. It has classic cherry, red-currant and cedar flavors, and while there's a sweetness at the core, the finish is thoroughly dry. Wonderful to drink now with steak or lamb.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is bone dry, with plenty of acidity and tough tannins. It's not offering much relief, despite an evident core of blackberries, currants and cherries. Those tannins really lock the palate down, like a sandpaper straitjacket on the tongue. But you have to consider its origin in Yountville, a cool area noted for ageable wines. It hould begin to resolve its difficulties by 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A nice interpretation of Syrah, this shows fine Napa elegance and structure. Dry and complex, this 100% Syrah has flavors of ripe, crushed blackberry fruit, raw beef, iron and black pepper, with a touch of smoky oak. Try now with beef tartare or carpaccio for something different.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sicily's Tasca family does a terrific job with this golden Chardonnay. The wine reflects the sunshine, warmth and generosity of the island. Aromas of stone fruit, vanilla, rose and almond blossom are followed by a beautifully creamy mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of toast, espresso and meat juices lead the nose.

There is a strong mineral texture, with tannins that come from ripe fruit as well as wood. The whole wine is finished with acidity, spice and a full-bodied, rich aftertaste.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With big, ripe fruits, this powerful wine oozes rich plum and spice flavors. It is dark and intense, concentrated with both acidity and wood aging. A line of freshness gives this dense wine an impressive lift of raspberry and red currant flavors. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard that lies just beneath the Grand Cru vineyards of Gevrey-Chambertin, this is a well-structured wine. It has a smoky character from the wood aging, giving complexity to the red fruits and dense texture. The acidity of the vintage shows strongly, giving a fruity aftertaste. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Still way too young, this is developing into a substantial and structured wine. Full of both fruit and tannins, it is dark and dense, very dry at this stage but with the most enticing perfumes. The Grand Cru, split between Chambolle-Musigny and Morey Saint-Denis, is known for its structure and this wine is a great example. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The lifted, pure scent of damask rose after rain hits you first. It is then joined by riper notions of Mirabelle but always with fresh, airy lift. While the palate weighs this down with perceptible sweetness, the aromas rise unfettered. This is a beautiful wine singing with rose and orange aromatics that persist with a lingering perfume.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of violet, baked plum and cake spice lead the way on this bold, elegant wine. The velvety palate offers juicy black cherry, ripe blackberry, licorice and black pepper accompanied by firm, polished tannins that give it a smooth texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of steeped cherries, ripe plums, scorched earth and a medley of cooking spices lead the nose on this round, rich wine. The lush palate doles out ripe black cherries, raspberry jam, licorice and a dash of black pepper while velvety tannins lend finesse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subtle notes of orange meet freshly-cut pear flavors, amplified by some residual sugar. The richness of the palate is cut beautifully by a fresh and pure, citric acidity and a wrought phenolic structure which lends pleasant notes of subtle, enticing bitterness. There is something bittersweet about this that is touching and alluring.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Honeyed notes of pear promise oriental richness. The palate cuts this opulence, edged with Seville orange spice and a streak of zesty lime. This interplay between baroque and discipline continues, creating a scintillating experience. Enjoy the ride and marvel at all the spicy overtones.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crushed blue flower, ripe plum and a whiff of exotic spice emerge on this bold wine. On the concentrated palate, ground pepper, cocoa and licorice notes accent ripe black cherry and baked plum. Velvety tannins lend elegance and support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Full-bodied and firmly structured, this offers aromas of dark cherry, mocha, blue flower and a whiff of exotic spice. The concentrated palate doles out black cherry, raspberry jam, raisin, chocolate and baking spice alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Name and reputation get you only so far, as this underwhelming offering from a poor vintage proves. Compact stewy aromas of baked berry fruits and asphalt are the appetizer. A main course of chunky jammy stewy berry and prune flavors finishes with a desiccated essence. Unico is known to age for decades, but not this vintage. Drink now for what it's worth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has intense forest-floor aromas, a hint of violet along and toasted oak and vanilla notes. The palate shows bright raspberry and espresso flavors, nervous acidity and firm tannins. It needs time, so drink after 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tastes rich and flashy now, with a rich array of oranges, pineapples and peaches, accented with oak. The acidity is just fine. Hanzell Chardonnays have a history of aging, so try stashing it for six years and see what happens.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Not showing well, with a heavy fullness of jammy berry-cherry fruit and strong tannins. Sweet oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Its future is hard to predict. Most wines that age gracefully start out impressive. This one just tastes overwrought. The score reflects crossed fingers for improvement.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Strawberry, rose petal, dark spice and a whiff of oak lead the nose and follow through to the robust palate along with steeped black cherry and a vanilla note. Firm tannins grip the finish. You'll also notice the warmth of alcohol on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by pronounced oak on the nose and entry, this wine unwinds slowly in the glass, though the intensity of toasted notes and richness never lets go. Along the way, there's a sour tang of salt and lime atop thick flavors of baked apple.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dried herbs and coconut flakes provide an intriguing entry into this medium-bodied wine. Dotted with Asian spice and soy, the fruit is more savory than sweet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is made from 80% Syrah and 20% Grenache, the grapes sourced from two estate vineyards on Howell Mountain. Thick, peppery meat and leather notes are framed by densely layered tannins and an impressive backbone of acidity. It finishes in a flourish of pretty mountain flowers and wild vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a robustly built, densely packed and velvety wine with smooth layers of integrated oak. Tannins provide the power and foundation behind its crisp blue fruit and dried herb flavors, seasoned with cola and black pepper spice.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A partnership between winemaker Jesse Katz and Colorado-based sommelier Brett Zimmerman, this 100% varietal wine is intensely powerful and concentrated yet balanced between ripeness and body. Cranberry and cassis fruit meet savory pine and leather notes, settling into a finish of smooth clove and pipe tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red currant, vanilla, toasted oak, coffee and chocolate aromas lead the nose and follow through to the dense, full-bodied palate. It's one-dimensional but muscular, with ample, velvety tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Just delicious, a nine-vineyard blend from some of the cooler pockets of this sprawling appellation. But don't let the tasty succulence mask its considerable complexity. Light in color, silky and almost weightless in the mouth, it delivers a massive blast of acid-tinged flavors. Ripe, sweet raspberries, cherry pulp, red licorice, sweet pomegranate marmalade, root beer, cloves, smoky oak, a final dusting of crushed black peppercorn, it just goes on and on. Highly recommended despite the hefty price.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Simple and straightforward aromas of red berry and mineral cap the aromatic nuances expressed in the Brunello Riserva. What the wine lacks is complexity, although it does feel rich, smooth and bright in the mouth. A Marc de Grazia selection; various American importers.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in the Nickel & Nickel style, which is very dry and considerably more tannic than its peers in Napa Valley, this Merlot needs some time in the cellar to shed its astringency and let the cherries blossom. The vineyard is in a cooler, southerly part of the valley.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello Riserva offers wood-driven notes of spice and smoke backed by ripe fruit and blackberry preserves. It is sweet and rich in the mouth with loads of jammy fruit on the close.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is undeniably a concentrated wine offering a complex set of very appealing aromas and flavors (singed grapefruit peel, honey, caramel). However, it is a bit out of balance at 15.5% alcohol and finishes shorter than one has a right to expect in this triple-digit price range. It's starting to show some development and will probably not improve, so best to drink up soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Brunello represents the 2005 vintage perfectly. The wine is not dense or over-concentrated and the aromas are bright and polished. Everything comes in moderation. Pair this wine with lean cuts of red meat on the grill.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A taste of juicy red cherry provides a brightness of acidity to this wine, a 100% varietal aged in entirely French oak. Soft, integrated tannins form a foundation around dried herbal notes and black pepper, working seamlessly together to an elegant end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This round, structured Syrah opens with aromas of ripe black fruit, tilled soil and ground black pepper. The palate shows mature blackberry and raspberry together with notes of spice and clove. Velvety tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas suggesting mature plum, scorched earth, clove, menthol and a hint of iris lead the nose. The ripe, one-dimensional palate offers mature black cherry, raspberry jam and cooking spice alongside fine-grained but not very persistent tannins. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak, coconut, toast, espresso, menthol and a whiff of cellar floor are some of the aromas you'll find on this robust red. The big, warm palate offers raisin, date, licorice and roasted coffee bean. Teeth-coating tannins leave an astringent finish while the heat of evident alcohol throws it off-balance. While it's tightly tannic, there's not much fruit richness, making this more suited for mid-term drinking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of the two Cabernets and Merlot, the '04 Trilogy shows the wine's traditional elegance. The flavors are extremely ripe, suggesting blackberries, cherries and cocoa, with a sugared finish. Fully drinkable now due to the softness of the tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Thin, crisp and short on the palate, this bright expression of Cortese offers a focused bouquet with tones of white flower, crushed stone and citrus. Try it with smoked salmon p\\u00c3\\u00a2t\\u00c3\\u00a9 on toasted bread.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A terrific wine, smooth, complex and ageworthy. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon from Diamond Mountain, it shows mountain intensity of fruit, with a molten core of blackberries and black currants. The tannins are bigtime, yet smooth and refined in the modern style, and the finish is elaborate in fruits and spices. A monument to what this fine winery can achieve at the top level. Hold until 2015, after which it should provide great drinking for additional years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Showing the art of blending, this small-production Pinot was made from the fruit of six vineyards. It is an exceptional expression of the Sonoma Coast, being translucent in color, dry, silky and crisp in acids. The flavors are complex and delicious, with berries, cherries and persimmons conjoined with mushrooms, spices and new oak. Lovely now, and should develop interestingly over the next 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Another fine 9-3-5 Cabernet from Hunnicutt. The numbers symbolize the proprietors' wedding date. It's a splendid wine, if a little too young. Toasty oak and tannins dominate, but way underneath is a vast, sweet network of blackberries and black currants. You can certainly decant it for a few hours and enjoy now, but this is a wine that should age seriously for a good 8, 10, 12 years. It's a blend of St. Helena, Rutherford and Oakville fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A helluva Cabernet. Extraordinarily rich and opulent in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, with elaborate oak, yet completely dry, and given balance by firm, hard tannins and a fine cut of acidity. Really impressive now, after decanting, and should develop over the next six years, at the very least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From western Paso Robles, a dark, full-bodied wine, with ripe, fresh cherries, blackberries, grilled meat and spices. An opulent, fleshy Pinot that finishes a little sweet and jammy, almost like Grenache.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a softness to this dry wine. It's forward and rich in currants and smoky oak, but could use greater acidity. The tannins also seem a little ungainly, although they could mellow out in a few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Michele Satta's estate is located in the southernmost part of the denomination. This Sangiovese-based wine offers delicate nuances of blackberry, spice box and dried hay but also has natural rubber or Band-Aid notes that disturb an otherwise pretty picture. Drink now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Despite the obvious quality of this wine\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094obvious in its vibrant ruby color and full bouquet of berry and spice aromas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094there's a tiny touch of something pungent that recalls kerosene or alcohol. The structure is firm and solid without being bulky and it delivers flavors of small berry fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here's a beautifully aged Amarone from an excellent vintage. Masi's Mazzano is a benchmark wine for Valpolicella thanks to its intriguing complexity of aromas: black cherry, dried fruit, porcini mushroom, dark chocolate, vanilla bean and dark resin like the kind you'd smell in an antique furniture shop. The wine has a slightly brownish hue and remarkable penetration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Merryvale's Profile remains a star year after year. The '04 is nearly all Cabernet Sauvignon, and stuns with its power. With a smooth, complex tannin structure, it's rich in currants, blackberries and cedar, but is too young to open now. Should hit its stride around 2010 and continue to develop for some years after. Tasted twice, with consistent results.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This strong dessert wine is made from 100% Petite Sirah grapes from a particular site and was bottled in 2013. Salty, mushroom and earth aromas drift upward from the glass followed by a thickness of sour-sweet dark chocolate and raisins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and aged just over 10 years in barrel, Noble Companion is thick and hot, opening with a tawny taste of roasted pecans, viscous on the palate. It was bottled in 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Reminiscent of a Peppermint Patty or Thin Mint cookie, this is a soft, smooth and somewhat nondescript wine, given ample time in bottle before review. Easy to drink, the tannins are mellowed and the oak subtle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tasting higher in alcohol than listed, this is a soft, somewhat jammy, simple wine. It offers raspberry preserves and chocolate around generous oak and sweet tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A mix of 48% Merlot, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Cabernet Franc and 4% Petit Verdot, all from Pickberry Vineyard, this wine is surprisingly light bodied and lean, despite a big presence of tobacco and grippy leather. The fruit is elusive, finishing with a flurry of cedar and clove.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This warm expression of Nebbiolo opens with aromas of stewed prunes, resin and raisin. The palate offers plums steeped in spirits and espresso alongside green wood tannins that generate an abrupt finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toasted oak, coffee and vanilla lead the nose and carry over to the palate along with dense cherry extract and espresso. Raspy wood tannins leave an astringent, abrupt finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of pressed rose, red berry, chopped herb and espresso lead the nose. The firm palate offers juicy black cherry, licorice and a hint of mocha alongside a backbone of fine-grained tannins. Drink after 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A blend dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this is a likable wine, rich in red berry, currant and vanilla. Firm, integrated tannins behave on the back of the palate, allowing for a softness amid the robust, full-bodied concentration.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Nearly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, with smaller additions of Malbec, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, this red doesn't skimp on richness nor oak, showing layers of chocolate liqueur and coconut flake. Soft, mellow tannin that retains some dustiness rides alongside juicy boysenberry.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A big firmly structured wine with solid tannins and black-plum-skin texture, the wine is rich and dense. Its fruits are balanced by the concentrated tannins and by the sense of restrained power. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A delicious, refreshingly crisp wine, this has an excellent balance between acidity and bright apple fruits. In the background, the wood aging and vanilla flavors give an extra dimension.

It is a delicious wine that is light, fruity and likely to age quickly. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The white wines of Pernand-Vergelesses have managed to preserve a cool, crisp character even in warm 2015. This wine has the citrus well to the fore along with flavors of wood aging and spice. It is tangy and mineral, with a bright textured aftertaste. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh, fruity, relatively lightweight, this offers immediately pleasurable drinking. Tannins give a counterpoint, but only play a minor role.

A smoky edge accompanies tastes of red cherry. The wine is rounded and light with attractive final acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tobacco leaf and dried herb dot the landscape of this velvety wine, made from the producer's estate-grown grapes. Blackberry and dusty mocha are girded by bittersweet tannin and toasted oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine combines 90% Sangiovese with 10% Syrah and is both tart and grippy in tannin. Smoky char displays prominently on the palate, as more green elements of dried herb and cedar ride a quiet wave to the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While there are tannins, they are not as powerful as the appellation and year would suggest. Instead, there is bright acidity, strawberry flavors and a fresh feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine shows its 40% whole-cluster fermentation in its stemmy and exotic nature that won't please every palate as it develops a strong, savory character that holds on dearly on the palate. Chewy and peppery in leather, tar and pine, it shows the cranberry and rhubarb qualities of grapes picked just-ripe.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With crisp fruit well to the fore, this is a bright, lively wine. Its fruitiness is balanced by firm tannins that lie in the background, lending structure. It should be aged a little longer, so drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with bold intensity and delicate background tones of dried cassis, cola, licorice and cedar. It's a dry but exceedingly delicate wine with a fine texture and polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This austere Barolo opens with a ripe note of prune and blackberry followed by sweet spice and moist pipe tobacco. The wine is chewy and rich with a succulent quality of tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Notes of ripe cherry, plum, cola, barbecue smoke and dried rosemary open the bouquet. It offers chocolate and spice in the mouth, with a touch of drying astringency on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Balanced, bright and dense, this powerful offering delivers a bold, masculine mouthfeel with flavors of dark fruit, spice and bitter chocolate. The finish is drying and astringent; drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows clean and polished aromas of cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis, wild berry, cola, ginger and dried mint. The mouthfeel is linear and bright but also firm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A bold and modern expression of Nebbiolo, this shows bright, pulpy fruit and pretty aromas of blackberry, crushed clove and earthy, rusty tones. There's a touch of bitter almond on the finish and loads of elegant fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with plump cherry fruit and some oak shadings. It has bold intensity with a modern flair and has the high acidity, fresh fruit and tight tannins needed for successful cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots to like in this Cabernet, which has ripe, juicy flavors of blackberry, plum, dark chocolate and flashy oak. Made thoroughly in the modern style, it's marked by soft tannins and a certain uniformity. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A little too soft and gentle for a Sonoma Coast Pinot, this lacking some dynamism, but there's no denying the deliciousness. It offers lush waves of raspberry and cherry pur\\u00c3\\u00a9e, mocha and anise liqueur that are easy to love.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This smells ripe and full, and the palate confirms it. The wine is wood-aged and this broadens its character\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094the extra year means fruit is diminished, while the richness is increased. The finale brings some essential acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Massively rich and ripe, a big, glamorous Chard that caters to the contemporary style. It's front-loaded with white sugar, tropical fruit and oak flavors. Sometimes less is more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This high altitude vineyard reliably produces enormously ripe fruit with correspondingly giant alcohol and tannin levels. The palate is full of chocolate-covered raisin and blackberry jam flavors, but it's a little over the top.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is still a young wine, with its ripe red fruits and black cherry flavors. The taste of licorice mingles with the fruit and balances with the smoky toast flavors. It's a rich wine that needs time, so drink from 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a structured, fairly austere Cabernet fermented in stainless steel and then aged in French oak. Dark and concentrated, the profile ripe in blackberry, cedar, sage and bittersweet chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Significantly full and expansive in vanilla, lemon curd and toasty oak, the Durell Vineyard shows its power here, generous in ripe flavors and rich earth. Aged just under a year in a majority of new French oak, it's built to age through 2025 or more.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dark in color, this is a rich, opulent, almost showy wine. The fruit is ripe, a combination of the sweetest strawberries with black cherries, laced with rich acidity. Then the tannins power in, a dry core of structure and density. Impressive and long-lasting, don't touch this wine for another six years at least.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A wonderfully complete wine, with all the elements in place. It is ripe and powerful, the black fruits jammy and rich. But at the same time, the layer of acidity, the dark tannins and the succulent texture all come together in a finely balanced way. It is almost exotic, but the tannins promise good potential for aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Big and bold, this is real Chambertin, a dense mouthful of plum fruit and tannin. It is foursquare, solid but not overbearing, leaving room for a delicious mix of black fruits and power leavened with some acidity. Age this wine for 10 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here is an ageworthy wine, a proper grand cru. The spice from the wood is the dominant factor to begin with, and this needs more time to integrate. But already, the fruit is impressively ripe and jammy, a fruit salad of black and red berry fruits. The tannins are dark, brooding away in the background. Keep this wine at least five years, probably 10.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Smoky, rich, this wine packs a powerful punch of vibrant black cherry fruits, and generous sweet tannins. It is big, muscular, the structure wide and open. It shows richness and opulence, brought into line by a firm, youthful structure that needs five years or more to age.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Not all Clos Vougeot lives up to its billing, but this wine certainly does. With its superbly ripe fruit, a harmonious balance between fruit, tannins and acidity, and a full, generous texture, this is a wine to savor. It is a big wine in all senses, except that it has a great sense of proportion. Enjoy this wine in 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years, or age for 10.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Softly lush, complex in flavor, this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend impresses with power and authority. Thoroughly dry and firm in tannins, it shows classic flavors of black currants and cedar, with intricate notes of cherries, violets, tobacco, mocha and beef jerky. Beautiful now, and should develop for a decade.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This dramatically structured Cab needs time in the cellar. It straddles the old-fashioned style of long-aging and the modern style of immediate opulence. The tannins star, sticky and firm, but the wine, which contains minor amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, is so rich, so loaded in black currants, cherries, sweet ripe plums, chocolate, anise and smoky oak, that it seduces now. But best after the age of six.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: While it starts austerely, this wine is obviously going to be a powerhouse of red plum and other ripe red fruits. The aromas are smoky, and this also shows in the palate as the wine fills with juicy richness, finishing with tight acidity. Give it 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A complete wine that speaks of both richness and terroir. While the tannins are certainly there, they are dominated by rich black fruits, ripeness, power and concentration. It is the sort of wine that reveals many layers of flavor and complexity. Age for five years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a very fine, high level Cabernet that shows the impeccable nature of Mondavi Reserve. Yet it's also very tannic and far from being drinkable. Shows a vast repository of black currant, blackberry, black cherry and new oak flavors wrapped into a smooth, velvety mouthfeel whose finish goes on forever. Masculine and authoritative, it should continue to improve for many years. Drink now, with decanting, and through 2017, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Co-fermented with 4% Viognier, this is deeply floral on the nose. Tomato leaf, soy and lavender notes provide a savory, herbal landscape, yet it remains bright on the palate, as licorice and garrigue flavors float in.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A nose with oxidized baked-fruit aromas confirms that this 2008 is on the back side of its run. A jammy, reduced palate houses squeaky tannins and leads to a flavor profile ruled by raisiny, stewed berry fruits. Prune and baking-spice flavors control a soft, mature finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense intitial aromas suggest rubber on top of blackberry. In the mouth, this Tempranillo is deep as a trench, with layering and firm tannins. Flavors of toasty oak, blackberry, coconut and herbs dance together like a world-class ballet troupe, while the finish is textured, toasty and loaded with power. Drink from 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, complex black currant, dark chocolate, mineral and oak flavors mark this bone dry, extremely tannic young Cabernet. It possesses a firm structure and mouthfeel, so give it until 2020 to begin to come around.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this reserve is aromatically distinctive. A suggestion of grapefruit in the underlying acidity outlines pretty boysenberry, mulberry and sweet spices. It's beautifully balanced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Young and unintegrated, this Cab is nowhere near ready to drink. The sweet oak sticks out, overpowering the ripe blackberry, currant and herb flavors. Needs time. Give it until after 2009, at the earliest.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe, dry and oaky, with powerful black currant and cedar flavors. Shows its youth in the astringency of the tannins, which are fine but very hard. Could be a sleeper. Try after 2011.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: No questioning the ripeness of this Syrah. It floods the mouth with jammy cherries, blueberries, currants and chocolate, with a peppery edge accented by smoky new oak. A bit soft and obvious in its palate appeal, it's at its best now and for a couple years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tense and dark, this has firm, dry tannins that overlay black plum skin and black fig flavors. The wine shows richness but also a foursquare solid structure and weight that is balanced by a final sweet, satisfying juicy acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and burly, here is power from Pinot Noir. The tannins are firm, spiced with dark black fruits, rolling luxuriously around the mouth. A spike of acidity gives the wine some freshness, but it remains a big, plump wine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Valbuena is Vega Sicilia's so-called second wine, and this vintage is elegant and lithe. To equate it to Burgundian Pinot Noir is not a stretch, seeing that the nose is earthy and dry, with fresh flowers, leather and tobacco aromas. The palate is light and full of finesse, with airy cranberry, earth and cherry flavors. From a poor vintage, this is more than admirable. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is rounded, rich and full of ripe fruit. Its wood flavors, giving spice and vanilla, are a backdrop to the generous apricot and pear flavors and good acidity. Drink this wine from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This premier-cru vineyard, wholly owned by the Devillard family, has produced a broad, ripe wine. It is generous, somewhat muted at this stage although promising plenty of citrus and yellow fruits and acidity as it ages. The wood aging creates a smooth hint at the back. Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 62% Syrah, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Grenache shows relatively restrained aromas of dark chocolate, blackberry, crushed asphalt and baking spice. There is decent tension to the sour and ripe elements of the palate, with hearty flavors of black cherry, black pepper, fennel and vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is structured with solid tannins and a foursquare character. Ripe fruits with plenty of balancing acidity give this wine its density and its crisp edge. This is a fruity wine that will develop slowly and well. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Scents of mature wild berry, fragrant iris, chopped mint and a hint of leather come together on this. The round, no-frills palate offers up dried black cherry, anise and clove alongside mature, loosely knit tannins. It's already extremely accessible.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Attractive deep gold color. Rich, intense aromas showing some evolution. Earthy, savory, honeyed and spicy with floral notes adding lift and a touch of brown sugar. Opulent, rich texture with lots of honeyed tropical and stone fruit flavors with notes of nutmeg and mace. Bright acidity adds freshness and balances the slight sweetness. Fairly full-bodied with a long, lingering spicy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Be careful when you look for thense wines, the labels at Aschieri are a little confusing;  a small white strip label at thumb level distinguishes the Sorano ordinaire from the special Costa Bricco. The wine, itself, is thick and quite poerful, with very ripe dark fruit, roses and earth flavors. It is beginning to show its age, and did not seem quite as fresh as the Sorano, but it proved to be more intense and extracted.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Attractive mid-gold color. Fairly muted nose of very ripe stone fruit. Medium-bodied with moderate concentration of juicy citrus and sweet stone fruit flavors. Softish texture, smooth across the palate. Not very complex, but gentle and pleasing flavors. Medium length and fruity, honeyed finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It took a couple of minutes for the smelly chemical aromas to disipate, but afterwards it showed a good deal of ripe fruit, earth and smoked meat. On the palate it proved to be soft and chunky, with most of the flavors at the front, and although the flavors were not as intense in the mid palate, they did return and the wine ended with a pleasant medium finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Delicate aromas of hawthorn, white spring flower and a whiff of orchard fruit aromas lead the nose on this refined sparkler. The vibrant palate doles yellow apple, citrus zest and toasted breadcrumb accompanied by an elegant mousse.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a vineyard in St. Helena, a source for this producer since 2004, this shows a generosity of extracted fruit built around burly bursts of black pepper, leather, black currant and cedar. It manages to be bright and refreshing on the lengthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vintage after vintage, this wine impresses in its tension of power and grace. Leather and cigar provide the savory yin to the wine's perfumed cedar and sage yang. With additions of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon in the mix, accents of currant, blueberry and blackberry add succulence and flavor. Decant before enjoying or cellar through 2023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Sold in a squat bottle that looks like it's from the Prohibition era, this unfiltered, unfined wine offers dense black currant, stewed blueberries and violets on the fruit-driven nose. The palate is also a dense monster, with strong licorice and tobacco meshed into cassis fruit, held together by popping acidity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of baked plum, cake spice, purple flower and a balsamic note jump out of the glass. The full-bodied palate shows power and finesse, delivering dried cherry, fig, vanilla, nutmeg and pipe tobacco while firm, velvety tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This isn't sweet, but just so wonderfully rich. It's the concentration of botrytis that makes the wine. The texture is velvet, but with a spicy bite to it. Apricot, honey and marzipan all contribute to a wine that will age over decades.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Monte Lodoletta Amarone is an exercise in extraction. The wine is absolutely black. Aromas are concentrated and intense and the wine is equally enormous in the mouth thanks to the extraction, oak, fruit and the hot climatic conditions associated with this vintage. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromatic herb, pressed rose, blue flower, menthol and mature berry aromas lift out of the glass.

Drink sooner rather than later to catch the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of blue flowers, blackberries and cake spices lead the nose on this smooth, structured wine. The palate delivers baked plums, prunes marinated in spirits, cinnamon, white pepper and tobacco alongside soft tannins. It has good length and closes on a chocolate note.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, porcini mushroom, scorched earth and prune lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The concentrated palate offers blueberry extract and black plum, while notes of mocha and black pepper add depth.

The savory palate delivers mature black plum, blueberry extract, white pepper and mocha alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. It's surprisingly accessible already but will develop more complexity with aging. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Old vines give this single-parcel wine its power and concentration.

But could the selection have been more severe? The wine seems mature and ready to drink, with a pleasant blend of toast and cassis, coffee and some herbaceous notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Billowy tannins star in this blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 13% Petit Verdot, 11% Malbec, 10% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc.

It's a bold, masculine wine with an attractive personality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of all five red Bordeaux varieties, with Cabernet Sauvignon taking the lead position at 65% and Merlot following at 22%. It shows classic characteristics of tart red currant, dried herb and cigar box within a full-bodied richness that's seamlessly smooth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of French oak, coconut, blue flower and spiced plum emerge in the glass. The firm palate offers black currant, espresso, tobacco and vanilla while fine-grained tannins provide support.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas of resin, blue flower, spiced plum, leather and menthol on this boldly structured red. Densely concentrated and chewy, the palate delivers blackberry jam, black cherry extract, mocha, tobacco and a confectionery note alongside velvety tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This big, bold red in a leopard-spotted bottle is made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, and it's powerfully concentrated with tobacco aromas, boulder-sized tannins and cherry-like fruitiness. Ancillary sparks of cedar and sage contribute intrigue.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light garnet in color, this wine has a subtle bouquet that is redolent of blue flower, almond paste, tobacco and even citrus. The palate feels tight and crisp.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from fruit sourced from a parcel in Fourchaume, this fruity wine offers green fruit flavors that are cut by the minerally texture. It is crisp, taut and nervy, and it needs a few years to show its best.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Four out of five of the Bordeaux red varieties are represented here, as well as Petite Sirah. The mix is juicy in cherry and cranberry, supported by a soft, tannic backbone that's somewhat dull on the finish, accented along the way by oak and leather.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The producer describes this as a Super Tuscan blend and it is based on 93% Sangiovese, with smaller amounts of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon. The combination is tight, sour and thin, lacking in fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A wine of this size and weight has nowhere to go on the palate, remaining massive, sour and puckering. A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon given plenty of time in oak, it's cranked too high.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Not many producers get fruit from this magical vineyard, sought after for being cool, coastal and meticulously farmed. This wine speaks to all that, offering sublime Meyer lemon, pear and golden honey around a balanced soul and wild ginger-infused intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With its patented blend of ripe plum and berry aromas matched against notes of wood smoke, herbs and leather, this is ripped and focused in the mouth, with strong but manageable tannins.

Dry and herbal, it sings in bold notes of red currant, cedar and anise, offering elegance around integrated tannins and a mouthcoating finish. Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A majority of Cabernet Sauvignon drives this blend, with 34% Sangiovese and 12% Petite Sirah providing spice and substance. Black leather, chocolate and a distinct taste of baked strawberry provide flavor atop soft, full-bodied layers of high-octane intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stony, peachy notes are evident on the nose. The palate confirms these and majors on that stony, structural framework. Pervaded as it is by ripe stone fruit flavor of yellow plum and peach, there is a pleasant bitter edge, reminiscent of honey. This is an exciting tightrope walk between the slightest smidgeon of residual sweetness and electric acidity, finishing dry. Ready now, will drink well until 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A strong marking of cedar, pencil and green tobacco exude aromatically and emphatically before soft, silky waves of integrated oak and tannin play on the palate. Elegant, this wine finishes in a hurry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is well made, structured and built to age. A wealth of baked plum meets clove, leather and mouth-coating tannin weight, as a full-bodied concentration of meaty texture provides heft and depth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intensely floral scents of fragrant blue flower and rose mingle with red berry and a whiff of dark spice. On the elegant, structured palate, star anise and cinnamon accent juicy Marasca cherry and crushed raspberry. Firm refined tannins and bright acidity provide seamless support. It's savory and loaded with finesse. Drink 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leather, licorice and balsamic aromas slowly take shape in the glass.

Aromas of red and purple flowers meet with wild sagebrush, roasted coffee and persistent black-cherry ripeness. The mouthfeel is soft but with an upright tannic structure, delivering flavors of blackberry, cocoa and dried sage.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Intense aromas of menthol, pressed rose, dark spice, new leather and wild berry take shape on this fragrant full-bodied red. Concentrated and structured, the dense palate delivers Marasca cherry marinated in spirits, licorice and a hint of exotic spice framed in firm refined tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a genuine and straightforward red wine from Piedmont that would pair with oven-roasted pasta or meat loaf. The wine (made from Nebbiolo and 20% Vespolina) is lean and fresh in the mouth, but ends with a very focused blast of almond and marzipan like flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite its age, you can still smell sawdust, dry oak and resin on the nose. The palate is acidic and drying, with tight plum, cola and raspberry flavors. The finish warms up some, with caramel and roasted fruit notes. Nice and tasty, and ready to drink now through 2011.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bright, round wine, with a layer of firm mineral tannins, but more about black berry and plum fruits, jammy acidity and a finishing dry structure. This second wine of Vray Croix de Gay will be ready in 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A good, brisk, dry wine that's somewhat tough and resistant now, but seems to have the stuffing for the cellar. The tannins are strong and make for a sandpapery mouthfeel. But the core of blackberries, black cherries, cherry liqueur and cedar is very intense. You want to give this fresh young wine a good six years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tons of blackberry, black cherry and cassis flavors in this dry, tannic wine. It's somewhat direct now, like fruit jam tarted up with citrusy acidity. Could age well, but it's a close call to predict.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark in color, soft in structure and rather heavy, this is a good Pinot Noir that doesn't quite rise beyond a drink-me-now polish. It has jammy flavors of cherries, blackberries and mocha. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot. We think it will; in five years it should trade in the current burnt steak notes and fierce tannins for softer touches and more complex flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a Merlot-Cabernet blend from St. Helena and Oakville. It's pretty good, dry and rich in black currants, cherries and oak. The tannins are stronger than on your average gooey cult Cab, with a peppery astringency suggesting modest aging. Try after 2008.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from organically farmed grapes, this structured wine opens with an intense fragrance of violets, iris, leather and Mediterranean herbs.

It has some licorice flavors, intense black currant acidity and a touch of smokiness from the wood aging. It is a wine to age for several years; don't drink before 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Named after a pioneer of wood-aged Sauvignon Blanc, this wine has toast as well as rounded fruit. The subtle wood focuses on enriching the fruit and bringing out its steel and citrus character. The wine can certainly age, drink until 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine sources fruit from throughout Napa Valley, as well as 9% from Lake County and 1% from the Sierra Foothills, incorporating all five red Bordeaux varieties and a smidgen of Syrah.

Tastes primarily of plum, cherry and currant, with a snappy finish defined by red fruit flavors and length. Perfectly good and ready; can hold through 2014.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is young, surprisingly fruity at this stage for this normally textured, structured Grand Cru. A pure line of sliced apple and green-plum flavors are shot through with tangy acidity. The fruitiness and intense acidity will pass soon and the wine will develop the proper steely, tight and mineral character. It will drink at its best from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing scents of rose, fragrant blue flower, perfumed berry and chopped herb take center stage. Combining structure and finesse, the palate doles out juicy wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, mint and star anise while firm, polished tannins provide the framework.

It is rich and just toasty, but equally about the structured mineral texture and ripe citrus. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Close to the village of Aloxe-Corton, this vineyard is one of the smallest of the Corton grand crus. This wine, still fresh while also closed up with tannins, is dark, structured and has the potential to age many years. Intense red-berry acidity and a tight, dry core still convey youthfulness. Drink this impressive wine from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of well-toasted oak, cinnamon, crushed stones, cassis and plum form a fine nose. This is bullish on the palate, where heavy tannins clomp along. Savory flavors of tree bark, herbs and blackberry finish woodsy, with lightly stewed plum notes and hints of oregano and thyme. Drink from 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The nose is still a bit shy but eventually reveals underbrush, ripe plum and whiff of dark spice.

Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Earthy and structured, this opens with aromas suggesting underbrush, grilled porcini, sunbaked earth, wild berry and dried aromatic herb. The big, bold palate doles out layers of mature black cherry, raspberry jam, licorice, sage, tobacco and black tea. Firm, velvety tannins provide structure and finesse. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932029.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The initial impression is of toast and spice. Only slowly do the fruit and full-bodied richness of this wine become apparent.

Drink it from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard wine offers wonderfully balanced fruits and texture, along with ripe fruitiness. Apples, crisp citrus and warmer pear and peach flavors are all integrated into a texture that just hints at the herbal while being more about bright, fresh acidity and fruit. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in what the producer calls a Right-Bank Tradition, this red wine combines 69% Cabernet Franc with 27% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Sauvignon to classy, restrained effect. Perfumed in cedar and pencil shavings, it has fine, integrated tannins and an elegance to the lengthy, cassis-kissed finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of wild berry, underbrush and a whiff of camphor emerge in the glass. The palate delivers tart cherry, red raspberry, clove, anise and ground pepper alongside youthfully assertive but refined tannins and fresh acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Young and strong now, this has lots of primary berry and chocolate flavors. The oak hasn't been integrated into the wine, making it feel rustic, with an emphasis on the tannins and acids. Give it two or three years before opening, but not much more than that.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Nero d'Avola opens with mature black cherry, cinnamon and toasted almond aromas while the fresh, structured palate delivers juicy blackberry, raspberry jam and white pepper notes. Fresh acidity and polished tannins lend balance and a smooth texture. Enjoy through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Austere and elegant in its cool-climate, light-bodied way, this wine is dark and brooding nonetheless, offering a wild bramble of berry and rhubarb flavors.

Full bodied, the wine is nicely balanced, with acidity behind the strength, finishing with length and grace.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe black currant, spice, pressed violet, scorched earth and a whiff of cedar emerge on this boldly structured red. The full-bodied palate delivers dried blackberry, raisin, licorice and chewing tobacco, accompanied by firm, chewy tannins. A black pepper note signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This beautifully structured wine has tannins and a dry core, but they are surrounded by ripe black fruits and a smooth, luscious texture. Rich and full bodied, the wine is almost drinkable but it will certainly be better from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The grapes for this wine hail from esteemed sites, including Three Palms and Cork Tree, and their good farming shows. Cherry and cassis aromas and flavors provide the wine with vibrancy, while well-structured tannins and a juicy core balance each other out. The oak is integrated and the finish long.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Concentrated in raspberry liqueur and balsamic tanginess, this is a juicy, soft and smooth wine, with plenty of structure and complexity. Blackberry coats the palate along with a savory tip of tobacco and black tea, components that linger on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Heavy wafts of petrol and oak dominate at first in this wine, before some air and some swirling in the glass reveal more lifted aromas and flavors of lemon candy, green apple and apple tart.

Grippy on the finish, it should cellar well, a robust, full-bodied wine that finishes with a taste of coffee.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The producer's flagship high-end sparkler starts with 52% Pinot Noir, adding in 48% Chardonnay, a touch of residual sugar (10 g/L) and 44 months in bottle.

Round and smooth on the palate, it's enjoyable now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is aromatic, with ripeness that balances the bright green and white fruits.

While delicate in body, the palate is concentrated with apple and lime flavors, and finishes with a slick of beeswax and honey.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Whether due to vintage conditions or simply the result of re-prioritizing the brand, production of the Muleskinner has plummeted. Too bad, as this 100% estate-grown varietal wine is a unique expression of Walla Walla fruit. Here, it's tight, tannic and sharp-toothed with wild, brambly berry fruit in a compact frame.

It is more a wine that charms, is open, lively, spice and dried apricots working together with ripe acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Perfumed white flower aromas lead into a wine that is dense and ripe. As the palate opens up, white and yellow fruits, cinnamon and buttered toast all work their ways into a wine that is almost a meal in itself. Still young, of course, already fresh, it will surely deepen and broaden as it ages. Screwcap.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Still young, this is a wine that needs to open and ripen. But already there are signs of richness, a wood- and tropical fruit-flavored wine that is typical of the full character of a Corton Charlemagne.

Drink this decadent wine now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Enormously rich, a powerhouse Syrah packed with ripe red and black currant, cassis, blueberry, chocolate, coffee, cedar and spice flavors. The structure earns the wine extra points, with ultra-refined tannins and crisp acidity. Decadent, and at its best now, in its flashy youth.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Showing the typical power of Corton-Charlemagne, this is a classic wine that offers full-on fruit allied to a strong wood element. It is rich and bold, flavored with white fruits, apricots, almonds and spice. While it is drinkable now, it would certainly repay cellaring for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine from a parcel in the Fourchaume vineyard is a step up from the Fourchaume premier cru wine. That's because it has an extra edge of minerality, of apple skins and tight, ageworthy green fruits. With its final burst of acidity, this will certainly mature over the next 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An impressive wine, with its tense structure, its ripe pear and melon flavors and its layers of richness. The smooth wood shows slowly and gently as it underlies the fruit flavors. There is also power here, and a definite ability to age.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There is a definite richness to this wine, the ripe white fruit and melon flavors aided by a judicious amount of vanilla and toast. That makes the wine seductive, but Laroche does not forget its Chablis origins and leaves enough room for a core of grapefruit, steel and tight acidity. Screwcap.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of Olivier Leflaive's benchmark wines, showing how his winemaker Franck Grux keeps lightness, freshness and complexity all in play.

The palate reveals nearly overripe black cherry, cinnamon and clove alongside bracing, astringent tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Pure Merlot from the Barde-Haut vineyard gives a smooth and ripely fruited wine that is now on the way to maturity. It combines soft tannins, an elegant structure and juicy acidity. The aftertaste is fruity with a more mature edge.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Still firmly tannic, the wine also promises rich black fruits. It has weight, a solid, firm structure and good balancing acidity. Complex and powerful, it's only spoiled by the show of pepper from the alcohol.

A core of dryness show the wine is still developing. Drink from 2015.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a huge and impressive step up from the 2003 Astrales, which was fine but not at this level. Here we're talking about color, bouquet, palate feel, intense flavors, finish, you name it. It's pure, ultratasty, chocolaty, smooth and pleasurable. Astrales is the complete package and a wine to watch.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: After finding little to like about the blatantly overripe 2003 El Nogal, the '04 is a wonderful surprise. Yes, it's still a ripe, chewy specimen with aromas of prune, smoke, spice cake and leather. But in the mouth it delivers weighty plum, raspberry and cassis but also a delicate wrapping of chocolate and coconut. A lot to ponder, and better sooner than later. Drink now through 2011.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Capellanes waded through some weak efforts in 2002 and 2003, but this vintage marks undisputed excellence for a reserva.

It's lighter in style, soft and velvety in feel with a finish that lingers. Coming from a cool vintage, it puts a lot of elegance on display.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The dark honey-gold color leaves no doubt that this wine spent time in oak, but it's well managed and well integrated, allowing the ripe apple and pear to shine alongside fresh aromas of white flowers and orange blossom. Medium bodied, it offers a pleasant hint of coconut on the lengthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe berry, blue flower, Mediterranean herb and a balsamic note led the nose.

It gathers strength in the core, holds, and then expands into a finish dusted with cocoa and coffee.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's an earthy, savory expression of Barolo from the prized La Serra cru that truly shows Nebbiolo typicity. You'll recognize aromas of iron and mineral backed by cola, white mushroom, tar and cassis fruit. That earthy personality is followed by drying, dusty tannins and the wine is exceptionally long on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Milky chocolate and creamy almond paste open the nose of this ripe and rich Barolo. Shadings of citrus, spice, plum, licorice and root beer add to the complexity. This is a pure, elegant and traditional expression of Nebbiolo that needs another five to 10 years in the cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Putting your nose into a glass of Oddero Barolo Villero is like sniffing a handful of Langhe soil. This wine speaks highly of its territory with aromas of smoke, earth, forest berry, white truffle, hazelnut, cola, root beer, humus and dried apple skins. In the mouth, the tannins are impressively polished and fine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite its young age now, the 2006 Dardi Le Rose Bussia Barolo will go on record as a classy, charming wine with long aging potential. The mineral tones are well etched and are followed by luscious layers of red fruit and spice. The tannins still need time to soften.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Prunotto tends to exemplify a ripe, almost jammy style of Barolo with succulent cherry and smoked meat characteristics followed by vanilla, cinnamon, mineral, blackberry and licorice. The intensity is wonderful here but the wine still needs a few extra aging years in the bottle to relax those young tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a rich, ripe expression of Barbaresco with loads of bright fruit followed by generous notes of exotic spice and scented candle. The wine is smooth, rich and drinkable almost immediately. Or, you could safely cellar this wine five years or more: the natural fruit promises to evolve evenly   over the years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Elegant and structured, this offers aromas that suggest sunbaked earth, ripe woodland berry, chopped mint and a whiff of new leather.

Zesty citrus stars on the midpalate, giving way to more generous, rounded layers of vanilla cream. Age-worthy, it peaks in bursts of orange blossom and tangerine, and would be a lovely partner for some fresh oysters on the half shell.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with a healthy dose (21%) of Merlot, this luxurious, velvety wine is named for co-owner Craig Hall's mother. Blackberry jam, black pepper and a touch of thick tar mark the full-bodied deliciousness going on here, a totally pleasurable experience worth enjoying now, though it can be held through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This intriguing mix of cedar and cassis, with meatier elements of black licorice, sings in the glass, remaining restrained and elegant despite a full-bodied ripeness and cradling of French oak.

It's also tannic, suggesting cellaring until 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A fruity, fragrant wine, it has a light structure, soft tannins and generous, juicy red berry fruits.

That sense of the sea plays out on the palate in texture, too, with a stony note that lingers in nutty spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A clean-cut top note of citrus hovers above the otherwise still-closed nose. The palate comes in with a concentrated richness that is as much sustained by residual sweetness as it is by sheer force of fruit: candied lemon and orange, juicy pear, ripe mirabelle and yellow peach. There also is a zesty spicy pithiness on the midpalate that frames and guides the wine alongside invigorating lemon freshness that lets this finish off dry despite the richness. This is yet to unfold fully. Lovely now, sure to improve. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00942035.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Funky notions of yeast still cloud the nose. The palate gives us tense, concentrated lemon and tangerine zest at first but you feel that there is more strength, almost raw force, at the core of this that still needs to develop and work out its balance. This is a big wine, energetic and dry, intense and generous but not yet fully fledged. Drinking it now would rob it of its as of yet untapped essence. For now it is lemon purity that holds sway but there will be so much more. Cellar from 2022\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932035, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bold, beautiful wine benefits from the addition of 14% Merlot from the famous site, as well as smaller amounts of Petit Verdot and Malbec.

It opens with notes of spice, tobacco and black pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The celebrated Barbaresco Asili shows deep concentration and ripe fruit, with a bright cherry note and a perfumed blue-flower touch. Notes of sweet basil and chopped herb follow, giving the bouquet an aromatic lift.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a Merlot that presents simple but slightly muddled aromas of spice and fruit. The distinction between its various aromatic elements is not that clear, and the wine delivers a one-dimensional feel on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Starts out crusty and dark, with earth, leather and other savory aromas. The palate is clacky and tannic, with roasted berry, leather and slightly burnt and bitter oak accents.

A note of roasted coffee bean signals the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cherry fruit and a tense slate rockiness show on the nose of this blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Syrah, along with a bit of heat. Energetic, juicy plums and black cherries consume the palate, which is rich, lively with acidity and just a tad sweet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend made of up a majority Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine also includes Merlot, Sangiovese and Syrah. Licorice and red plum mingle on the palate, around a layering of cinnamon and black spice. Soft, the overall texture and body is substantial, finding a balance and trace of acidity on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak is front and center on this high-priced affair from Freixenet. And that's the primary problem with what is otherwise a commendable and solid wine. Vanilla and resin aromas and flavors push the fruit to the side, and what's left is a slick of butter, sawdust and tannic astringency. Not a bust, but for nearly a hundred bucks we want more than just wood. Imported by Freixenet USA.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Prinsi's Gaia Principe cru is located very near the Gallina vineyard and shows slightly softer and less intense aromas. Winemaking plays a big role here: This is an oak-driven wine that melds supple aromas of vanilla and sweet spice over a lively base of red fruit. There's also a mineral note of chalk or wet stone that lingers long on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This well-extracted and mature expression of Nebbiolo from the Antinori estate in Piedmont is a mature and fruit-driven expression of Barbaresco with dense concentration and a New World style. There's very good complexity here in the form of black licorice, chopped mint and rhubarb.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This base Barolo from the Antinori estate in Piedmont delivers a blast of bold flavors such as chocolate fudge, mature blackberry, spice and sweet fruit preserves. It earns high marks for the thickness and roundness of its mouthfeel and ends with a bright note of sweet berry fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sarmassa is among Barolo's top vineyard crus with south-facing slopes and white, relatively unfertile soils that help restrict yields. You can taste the evident mineral vein in this Barolo that appears as a dusty afterthought to the wine's aromas of black fruit, pepper and licorice. It's a ripe wine with firm tannins that need to unwind: drink after 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous wine although it definitely expresses itself better on the nose than it does in the mouth. The aromas include black fruit, sweet spice, cinnamon and cedar. The mouthfeel is cleansing, bright with medium length.

It's visceral once sipped, with thick jammy blueberry and plum fruits, bloody meats, leather, dark chocolate and coffee grinds.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Reserved aromas of ripe red apple, cherry, dried herbs and spice are followed by quite ripe black fruit flavors speckled with vanilla and cocoa notes. It doesn't all come together perfectly but still provides interest.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A full-bodied, quite ripe expression of the variety with an abundance of baked apple offset by a zest of lime, this wine is rich in vanilla and marshmallow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An easy-drinking blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 12% Petit Verdot and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this offers aromas of black currant, clove and roasted coffee bean. The polished, accessible palate shows cassis, toasted oak, licorice and mocha alongside fine-grained tannins. Enjoy over the next few years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, leather, dried plum, a whiff of French oak and a balsamic note lead the nose. The firm palate offers dried cherry, cranberry, licorice and espresso set against close-grained that leave a firm, rather drying finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Herbaceous aromas and a whiff of blackberry take center stage on this 65% Merlot and 35% Cabernet Franc blend. The dense palate doles out raspberry jam, French oak and white pepper alongside close-grained tannins that grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Three red-Bordeaux varieties combine in this blend, a soft, supple expression of baked plum with a subtle grip of leather. Texturally medium bodied, it shows an abundance of ripeness on the midpalate before settling into more classic elements of cedar and dried herb.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 45% Cabernet Franc, 45% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Colorino, this opens with subtle aromas of black currant, ginger and a hint of star anise. On the mature palate, notes of vanilla and licorice accent ripe plum while polished tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, this delicately fragrant wine offers alluring scents of dark-skinned berry, purple flower and a whiff of cedar. The bright light-bodied palate offers red currant and star anise framed in racy acidity and lithe tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, toasted hazelnut, dark spice, menthol and new leather emerge in the glass. The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, raisin, coffee and chewing tobacco while fine-grained tannins provide the framework. It finishes on a slightly bitter note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Savigny-l\\u00c3\\u00a8s-Beaune, better known for its reds, also makes small quantities of white. From a three-acre parcel, this wine is ripe and tangy with orange peel and mineral acidity. It is a wine that is aging fast and that will be ready to drink from late 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Stewed plum, freshly chopped meat, oregano and fennel serve as attention-grabbing aromas on this inky wine from Paso Robles' Westside. On the palate, the tannins are nicely even and smooth, and the herbal notes tend to overpower the tart cranberry fruit. It's very pleasant, if not quite completely full on the midpalate and finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The winery's '05 Cab is tannic and dry and elegant. It tastes like a young Bordeaux, a wine that needs time in the cellar to come around. The flavors are classic Napa Cab, all black currants, black cherries and oak. Just beautiful. Best after 2009, but good now with decanting and a big, important steak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Opaque in color, with reduced aromas of mushroom, rubber and so forth. But do not give up on this masculine bruiser; it will loosen up with air and offer plum, leather and chocolate flavors that are nothing short of excellent. And while it's a touch zesty at its core, the wine still mixes in enough coffee and richness to make it a modern-style success story.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Despite significant youthful tannins this Cab has such deep, ripe flavor that you can drink it now. The mouthfeel is astringent and hard, in the way of a young wine, but waves of cherries, blackberries and currants flatter the tastebuds, and it also softens as it warms up in the glass. A beautiful, polished drink that should develop over the next eight years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a wine to cellar. It's just too hard in tannins now to perform well, even though it has very deep and impressive flavors, such as crushed blackberries and cherries, cassis, violets, anise, dark chocolate and cedar. Shows a great return to form after a few under-performing years. Best after 2010.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from the famous vineyard named for its stony soils, this resplendent wine is powerfully crafted and bold. Coconut shavings and chocolate provide a luxurious flavor profile that meshes perfectly with the wine's lush grip of tannin and velvety mouthfeel.

With all the elements in place, it is well poised to mature slowly and gently into a very fine wine. Its concentration is balanced by fresh fruit and and honey notes. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a remarkable, lovely wine, made from a site in the extremes of Annapolis. It is delightfully complex and layered, with a richly concentrated palate of dark cherry, blueberry and Asian five spice, with spikes of sea breeze and tea.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: On the western edge of the appellation, in what locals call the Sebastopol Hills, this wine shows its provenance well, imparting wild, exotic aromas and flavors of crunchy red fruit and Asian spice. Silky, savory and inviting, it's also pretty, with impressive depth, persistent acidity and chunks of turned earth and pine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Menthol, new leather, white pepper, fig and forest floor are just some of the aromas you'll find on this fantastic wine. Smooth and structured, the full-bodied palate evokes dried cherry, licorice, baking spice, raspberry compote and a salty mineral note. Firm polished tannins provide smooth seamless support. Drink through 2031.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a big, fruity Cabernet. It's marked with strong blackberry, cherry and cocoa flavors that are almost candied, but the finish is dry and smooth. Tastes a bit simple now, but could develop beyond 2011.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This 2001 vintage Amarone shows elegant signs of age with aromas of old spice, dried fruit, dried porcini mushroom and pressed rose petal. It's a bit tired and flat in the mouth at this point, so if you have a bottle drink it soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: La Coeta is a massive wine that will appeal to those who appreciate a heavy oak element and dense extraction. Either way, you'll need to give this hearty Amarone a few more years to find balance. In the mouth, it sports dark fruit aromas and thick, chewy astringency.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Jarvis has tinkered with its Cabernet Franc over the years, and with good results. Today, its Cabernet Franc is among the state's best. Made from 100% Cabernet Franc, it's rich, full bodied and luscious, with notes of sun-ripened cherries. Could pick up some bottle nuance over the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This single-vineyard Barolo shows balsamic aromas of sage, eucalyptus and leather with raspberry notes. The palate delivers succulent black cherries layered with spice, mint and Alpine herbs. Reflecting the forward nature of the vintage, this is already drinking well. Enjoy now and over the next few years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Cabernet Franc and 11% Petit Verdot, this wine combines them all to herbaceous, slightly green and puckering effect, the oak overwhelmingly audacious.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine gives all kind of reductive funkiness on the nose, with overpowering rubber and tar aromas. It's sour once sipped and too tannic to drink right now, but time may forgive a little bit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: D'Amare is a rich blend of Chardonnay and Viognier, offering a thick, viscous mouthfeel and bright notes of apricot, pear, pineapple and exotic fruit. It shows fine density and a creamy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Barbera can be made well, but this one isn't even particularly Barbera-esque. It's soft, acidic and sweetly simple, with jammy flavors that are overripe and pruny.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Harsh and pruny, with overripe flavors that are like Port, except the wine is dry. Wildly over-priced for the quality.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: So delicious now, you can hardly keep your hands off it. Blackberry tart, ripe blueberry, cassis, milk chocolate, licorice and sweet, smoky cedar flavors flood the mouth, dramatically huge and memorable, and lasting long into the finish. The tannins are obvious, but sweetly ripe and soft. A brilliant evocation of Napa Cabernet, despite a high production level of nearly 30,000 cases, which is about the same size as a Bordeaux first growth. Shows the class and potency this bottling has exhibited for many years, and believe it or not, the price is a relative bargain these days. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is sophisticated stuff that lives up to Oakville's reputation. It tastes rich and alluring from the first whiff of black currant and espresso to the ultrasmooth mouthfeel and elegant finish. Think extra-fine tannins, opulent currant, dark chocolate and black cherry flavors. Enjoy it now or save through 2023 to encourage even more bouquet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of black currant, tilled soil, anise and saline lead the way on this polished Cabernet Sauvignon. The elegantly structured palate offers layers of cassis, black cherry, licorice and sweet baking spice. It's well balanced, with firm yet refined tannins and fresh acidity. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a structured wine, almost tannic in character. It has a rich, textured character that will allow the wine well. Apple and pear flavors are dominant along with the spice from wood aging. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a light, clear and beguiling wine, not for everyone, somewhat reduced and yet lurking in brooding fruit and interwoven spice. It drinks almost like a white wine in its shocking minerality, before delving into a dark and noble forest floor's worth of pine, wild mushroom and rose. Let this wine open awhile and enjoy how it changes in the glass.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the top Beaune premier-cru vineyards, this wine is dark and dense with hints of wood as well as chocolate. To balance this, the ripe berry fruit is right there, deliciously fresh and with a tight line of acidity. A wine with a future, it is not ready to drink before 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The winery's grand statement of the year, this blend of 73% Cabernet Sauvignon and 27% Cabernet Franc is sourced from several vineyards, including the Tonella site in Rutherford, Stagecoach atop Atlas Peak and Frediani Vineyard in Calistoga. Thick, rich and dusty, it exudes Rutherford's magical dust, followed by chocolate and black licorice, just a trace of fennel on the lengthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From an estate vineyard located in the heart of Rutherford that was purchased by the producer in 2006, this vineyard-designate is the star of the show, a blend of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with 9% Cabernet Franc. Thick, dense and robust in tannin and oak, it offers structured red and black fruit, dried herb, pencil lead, cedar and cigar, combining ripeness with cooler-climate characteristics. It should cellar well through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A flinty nose of citrus purity hints that this still requires bottle age, but all the elements of a great wine are present. It offers a bundled concentration of flavor and fruit, and a straight backbone of acidity pervades everything with a sense of purity. Right now, fresh citrus notes of lemon pith, peel and flesh dominate aromatically, but this will blossom. There are already inklings of honey and orange in the background but only time will reveal what cabinet of wonders is hidden here. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sleek by Amarone standards, this opens with aromas of ripe black cherry, ground pepper, raisin and a whiff of blue flower. On the palate, finely woven tannins support raspberry jam, black pepper, cocoa and a cinnamon note.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A heady mixture of lemon custard and baked pear marks the entry to this full-bodied, deliciously decadent wine, from a high-elevation site above the Petaluma Gap. Honeyed aromas maintain themselves in the glass, accented in floral honeysuckle and ginger. Lovely and generous, it softens as it goes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bold and rich, this opens with aromas of baked plum, pressed blue flower, nutmeg and a confectionary note.

The fruit lies behind the structure, with its powerful, dense character. Hints of the juicy, black-fruit future of this wine come through the texture. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a firm wine, full of tannins as well as plenty of ripe berries. It is concentrated, juicy and perfumed, an attractive wine already. The dry core gives structure to this panoply of fruitiness. The name comes from French king Louis XI who acquired the vineyard in the 15th century.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a rich and rounded wine, full of yellow fruits that shine through the tense texture. It is ripe, showing minerality as well as tropical fruits and red apples. The wine is going to age relatively quickly, so drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich in character, this is a dense wine, with smoky tannins and juicy red fruits that are deliciously ripe. The tannins and the fruit concentration result in a weighty yet brightly acidic wine. It will develop quickly, and then remain at a peak for many years. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Firm and structured, this wine offers dark tannins and concentration. It has the acidity of the year but with a solid texture. There are hints of the perfume and the delicious fruit to come, but they will take time to show. Don't drink this wine with its potential before 2022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Great white fruits, hints of peach and tight citrus-zest texture all give this wine its great freshness. At the same time the texture suggests minerality and a nervy edge. Hints of the wood are just right for this intensely fruity wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Two fistfuls of Merlot help soften this wine, along with 5% Petit Verdot. These grapes contribute to the full-bodied spirit and youthful tannin make-up that becomes plush and lush as it goes, revealing sizable elements of mocha, black currant and vanilla-tinged oak. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This extraordinary winery continues to produce some of Napa's most distinguished Cabernets. The vineyard is in the cool-climate appellation of Coombsville, which accounts for its superb structure of acids and tannins. Perfectly ripe black-currant flavors meld into toasty new-oak tones. At the age of more than six years, the wine is starting to mellow, but is only hinting at the drama to come. It has enough splendor to glidepath through the decades.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This big simple red opens with aromas of black currant, cedar and a whiff of blue flower.

This crowd pleaser is just extraordinary now, and should develop in the bottle over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Representing a breathtaking advancement over the '07, Sinatra's 2008 Cab is simply delicious. It's fleshy and fat in texture, with a glyceriney richness that makes it almost oily and that, when combined with caramelized oak, turns into nougat. The blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit flavors rise to the occasion. This is truly a stunningly good Cabernet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An extraordinary Chardonnay whose complicated richness is balanced with tight acidity and a firm grounding of stony minerals. Brings to mind a great Chablis, with its zesty tang followed by elaborate layers of tropical fruits and pears. Utterly delicious, wildly appealing, a wine that will develop bottle interest over the next six years. Only 97 cases were produced.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a Pinot Noir meant to be aged. No question about it, from the citrusy acids to the sandy tannins to the somewhat awkward primary fruit flavors that desperately want to resolve with the oak. Packed with raspberries and cherries, the wine is completely dry and firm in minerals, and seems easily able to age for at least six years. Only 120 cases were produced.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The longer this wine breathes in the glass the better it gets. At first sip, it's obviously a very good wine, richly tannic and deeply impressive in blackberries, cassis and oak, with a firm minerality that grounds it.

Really a great wine for drinking now, and so balanced, it will easily negotiate a decade in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Anyone who doesn't love this Pinot just doesn't understand California's approach. It's a fantastically delicious wine, completely satisfying in raspberry, cherry, persimmon, toast, spice and vanilla flavors, and balanced with bright, coastal acidity. Just beautiful, and it grows better as it warms in the glass. Probably not an ager, but wonderful now and through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a big, brawny wine that offers moderate structure, opting for richer, denser notes of leathery tannin and bittersweet tobacco leaf, its accents part cedar, part clove.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This gorgeous Brunello seamlessly weaves together sensations of tilled soil, blue flower, ripe black cherry, leather, truffle, clove, white pepper and Mediterranean herbs.

One quibble is the acidity, which is overly sharp and feels odd, given how ripe the wine is.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Charred oak, licorice, herbal blackberry and gamy notes make for a full array of aromas. This is big and tannic, but with a sense of fresh fruit. Plum and cassis are the core flavor components, while the finish is fleshy and not overly demanding.

Seamless interwoven tannins support a hefty weight of powerful ripeness defined by sultry layers of dark cherry and dark chocolate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Right next door to Mouton Rothschild, this small property is producing wines that are dominated by the rich, firm Cabernet Sauvignon of Pauillac. The weight and density are very present, a solid dry core surrounded by delicious black currant fruits. A wine that will mature relatively fast because of the vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It must be unique to find any Bordeaux in a Burgundy style bottle. Certainly this ultra-rich wine owes much to Burgundian Chardonnay. But under the sweet fruit, there is no mistaking the Muscadelle perfume and spice that give a bite, a dry, peppery finish and a very different character\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Syrah-Grenache blend is enormously rich, ripe and heady. It wears its 16% abv well, without ever feeling hot or awkward. Instead, fine acidity and firm tannins give the dark chocolate and blackberry jam flavors the balanced lusciousness of Port, without the sweetness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Awesomely rich and forward with cherry and raspberry jam, chocolate and spice flavors, this high-alcohol wine fortunately is balanced with adequate acidity, firm tannins and even a hit of minerals.

Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Baked plum, fragrant blue flower, dried herb, eucalyptus and cake spice aromas unfold on this full-bodied red.

It's already extremely evolved, and lacks vibrancy and complexity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Soft, billowy tannins buoy this wine's dense red fruit, accented with dried herb, cedar and pencil shaving flavors. Ripe and full bodied, its oak is integrated and quiet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blackberry, cherry and plum notes form this estate wine's fruity core, complemented by an earthy thread of cedar, pencil and tobacco. Dry, firm tannins give it a structure that takes time to unwind, the finish marked by powerful grace and spicy clove.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has firm tannins, and it demonstrates the potential of its juicy fruit flavors. With its powerful structure, this is a slowly developing selection that needs at least five years in a cellar.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of wines from a number of Chambolle's premier cru vineyards, this is a rich and generous wine, with spice and red berry flavors, plus sweet tannins and a firm feel on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A study in balance, this wine has dark berry and tobacco aromas that are elegant rather than overly intense. The palate reveals polished tannins and firm fruit flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Castello di Bolgheri enjoys some of the most coveted vineyard sites that are located a stone's throw away from the Bolgheri castle tower. The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, and it delivers black fruit aromas, backed by wet earth, button mushroom and leather notes. It feels plush, yet structured.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Perfumed, rich yet soft, this is opulent Beaune at its best. It has acidity and a touch of tannin, but it's the broad, ripe red-fruit flavors that dominate, which gives juiciness and vitality to this wine that will age for several years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Production of this Merlot was further dampened in 2009 by an early freeze. But the quality is as good as ever, which is apparent in the pretty core of strawberry, raspberry and red plum flavors. Aging in 55% new French oak gives the fruit a Bourbon-soaked appeal as it rolls onto the rich finish streaked with dark chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Initially smooth and rounded, this wine opens to reveal a structured character. A note of tangy lemon zest cuts through the pear and quince flavors, which creates a balance between richness and tautness. Ready to drink in 1\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wood-aged wine is rich and full. Its intense fruits are balanced by subtle wood flavors and a tight texture. Named after the Romans who were the first to plant vines in Sancerre, this is a concentrated wine that will repay some aging. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It opens with aromas of oak extract and burned tire rubber. The lean palate delivers toasted oak, vanilla and espresso alongside astringent oak tannins. It lacks fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This muted, tannic Cabernet spent 20 months in new French oak. The dark black cherry and berry fruit are overwhelmed somewhat by the toast and oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made with Cabernet and Merlot, this offers scents of cedar, black currant, graphite and aromatic herb.

Cellar this concentrated wine through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Meticulously farmed by Ulises Valdez, Silver Eagle is intensely spicy and pamperingly lush, offering a distinct, perfumed character on the nose.

It's well balanced, with velvety tannins and surprising freshness for what was a torrid vintage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine, which is from the Napa side of the sprawling Carneros appellation, is superb. It's soft, rich and chocolaty, with a rich vein of ripe blackberries, but it also has a tannic structure and dry finish that make it balanced and complex. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932015.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Just beautiful to drink now, despite grippy tannins that give the ripe fruit an astringent mouthfeel. Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla. Those tannins suggest pairing this wine with rich foods, such as lamb, but you don't want to smother the delicacy underneath a rustic stew. Drink soon, before it loses freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vintage was kind to Frazier, whose red wines excelled in 2008. This Cabernet Sauvignon, made by Kirk Venge, is classic Napa Valley. It's dry, richly textured in tannins, and complex, offering intense waves of blackberries, black currants, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis and oak. Yes, the alcohol is high, but who's counting? As good as it is now, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Expensive, yes, but it shows the drama and interest that a Joseph Phelps Cabernet predictably delivers. It's rich and ripe in blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors, with wonderful tannins and a dry finish. Best now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Some will critique this Pinot as too big and bold, but it defines the ripe, exuberant California style. It's fabulously rich in berry fruit, mocha and spice flavors. Nothing shy about it, and not particularly subtle in its appeal, but it does show meticulous vineyard care and terroir. Its future evolution is unclear, but this delicious Pinot Noir is a natural partner to full-bodied lamb and beef dishes.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Hard tannins currently lock this wine down. Although it's astringent, it's very polished and complex. Made from Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, in that order, it's marked by black cherry, red currant and cedar flavors, and finishes totally dry. The vineyard is in the cool Oak Knoll District, which helps explain the acidity and tightness. Difficult to predict if it will age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a robustly built, densely packed and velvety wine with smooth layers of integrated oak. Tannins provide the power and foundation behind its crisp blue fruit and dried herb flavors, seasoned with cola and black pepper spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot, aged nearly two years in 80% new French oak, is a ripe, extracted and mightily concentrated wine, offering big flavor in a complex package. Highlights include cedar, cherry and cocoa powder dusted in tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Petit Verdot from the trio of this blend, yielding rounded, red fruit-driven flavor. Dense tannins shoulder its body and weight, as savory anise, dried herb and pencil characteristics figure in.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vanilla, oak spice, tea, berry, olive and herb aromas signal a classic Rioja. Its crisp palate and choppy tannins form the canvas for spicy berry and cassis flavors. More spice powers the finish, which has the fruit to absorb and support the high level of oak. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Toro is known for its massive wines, and this fits the bill. Oak, tobacco and mocha aromas share space on the nose with cassis and berry scents. Fully extracted tannins and resiny oak create a sizable palate of plum, cassis and vanilla flavors. Oak-derived spice notes inflect the intense black fruit flavors on the finish. Drink through 2026.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine dazzles with perfection. Sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, it refutes the belief that a great Cabernet must come from a single vineyard. It does not. The master's art of blending, coupled with demanding vineyard practices lends completeness. The blend is 85% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Malbec, making it an extraordinary success despite the absence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Give credit to winemaker Pierre Seillan. The wine itself is absolutely dry. It starts with a tug of tannins, baring flavors of blackberries, black currants, minerals and new oak, with earthy, herbal and meaty complexities. This is a magnificent wine; it dazzles now and should evolve over the next 6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00938 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The 2008 vintage presented challenges for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this Cabernet Franc-based blend succeeds wildly. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, with flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, licorice and spicy cola. Ninety-five percent new oak lends this a wonderful toastiness. Few wines could handle that much new wood, but this one can. However, it's very tannic. You can drink it now, but it should blossom after 2014.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A spectacular wine that defines the upper limit of California Bordeaux-style blends. Based on Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with splashes of Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec, this is delicious and complex, offering a blast of blackberry, blueberry-concentrate and mineral flavors. Comprised of fruit grown throughout Sonoma County, this is a masterpiece of the art of blending. Absolutely dry and very hard in tannins, drink this from 2013\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The blend is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties added for complexity. The grapes were sourced from vineyards throughout Sonoma County, and the finished wine was aged in 75% new oak. It's very fine, with concentrated, intense blackberry, cherry and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis flavors.Minerality, in the form of granite, lends a lick of stone. It's still extremely tannic, and needs much more timebefore it begins to come around.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This reserve tastes oakier and stronger than Jarvis's regular 2006 Cabernet. With near-perfect balance, this is awesome. Flavors of blackberries and black currants are complexed with minerals and herbs and indefinable things from the soil. It's hard in tannins and rich in spicy, smoky new oak. Hold until at least 2014, and it should continue to age well beyond that.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Mature black-skinned fruit, raisin, crushed purple flower and baking spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this bold wine.

Given almost two years in 50% new French oak, it's intended to offer richness and concentration, and does it well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Scents of woodland berry, rose petal, grilled herb, anisette and a balsamic note emerge on this firmly structured wine.

Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A pure impression ripe Golden Delicious apples shows on the nose of this wine, while the palate majors in citrus. Dry and fresh, it offers tingling zestiness with a pleasantly bitter edge.

There is an earthy undertow but the palate sits serenely with its chiseled freshness and streamlined acidity. As you linger, every sip reveals different aspects of tart citrus, fresh-cut pear peel, ginger biscuits and chalky stone. The body is slender and dry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A flinty hint of reduction leads to a poised, juicy palate of tart apple, like a totally ripe Cox Orange Pippin, but utterly refreshing. Aromatic Amalfi lemon freshness offers more brightness while smoky glints add interest. There is a light touch here, leaving a fleetingly beautiful and yet lastingly memorable wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend offers beguiling, complex aromas of violets, scorched earth, cassis, black licorice and graphite. The flavors are tightly wound, showing poise and presence. It drinks well out of the gate but cellaring will be particularly rewarded. Best from 2022 through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Both the golden color and the advanced nose signal a mature wine. The nose has a lifted quality that references white sultanas, dried pineapple, chalk and cooked champignons, with sumptuous, pleasantly bitter notes of dark fir honey. Contrary to expectation, the palate is merely off dry. It has an intriguing, almost salty quality with inflections of soy-sauce savoriness and immense depth of flavor. Still is sprightly and fresh, the wine has a streak of lemon freshness at its core. Lovely now and mature, it can be enjoyed until at least 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: After skipping a vintage, this Rocks District wine is an aromatic tour de force, with notes of grilled asparagus, stems, black and green olives, crushed flowers and mineral, revealing more on each swirl. The palate brings abundant savory flavors that are simultaneously intense and reserved, with a sense of balance that is captivating and a finish that kicks it up a notch.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The golden color suggests evolution and the nose does not disappoint, presenting lifted notes of petrol, saffron, candied lemon and mandarin. Rich sweetness on the palate pairs with 2010's laser-sharp acidity, becoming more honeyed with each moment. This acidity still rings with greengage and lime freshness, providing lift.

Still, it's a sound wine that will find plenty of admirers. Ready now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From an estate vineyard only six miles from the ocean, this wine is steeped in coolness, from its sharply tuned pomegranate and tart cranberry to its mushroomy, damp earth tones and savory spice.

In style it hovers halfway between the ripe, buttery Meursault of the past and the crisper style of today, a fine compromise and ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is initially rather closed but eventually reveals dark berry, blue flower and brown baking spice. The ripe palate offers mature black cherry, coffee, cocoa, star anise and chopped sage alongside tightly packed tannins.

Integrated oak helps make it approachable and fruit-forward, while the finish is subtle in fireplace smoke.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wild strawberry and a thicket of dense tannin belie a powerfully strong and elusive wine, still very much tightly wound, indicative of the vintage. A portion (35%) of the grapes were whole-cluster pressed, from tight-spaced, low-yielding vines. A little more oak was used than in most of the producer's other wines, helping to impart a spicy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a bit ripe and raw with notes of blueberry, some strawberry, black ink and background shadings of graphite or charcoal.

This balanced wine will develop attractively and quickly. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich fruit, layered with acidity, stars in a wine that is dense, very much a product of the powerful 2005 vintage. With the concentrated tannins, this is showing that it needs to age, but already the sweet fruits are opulent and soft.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It is entirely conceivable that this blend of the two Cabernets could improve dramatically with time in the bottle. Currently, it's a very dry, firmly tannic wine, with black currant, mocha, cherry and new oak flavors that have a distinctive edge of sweet herbs, figs and tobacco. Improves considerably with airing in the glass, so decant if you drink it anytime soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firm and tense, this is a wine on the high wire. The tannins are stretched with acidity, the berry fruits and red cherry flavors vividly standing out against this structure. The aftertaste is fine, poised, mineral. This is developing into an important wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very fine, a smooth, silky wine with an elegant mousse, or quality of bubbles.

Easily the most complex and interesting of Chandon's lineup of sparklers.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dense, concentrated, solid, this wine shows the stern side of Nuits-Saint-Georges. The tannins are dry, very firm and rough at the edges. The fruit is just as edgy, with black, juicy plums surrounded by smoky wood and tobacco. The wine needs to age, although it will always have a solid, structured character.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: In its early stages of evolution, this wine offers mainly stoniness, firm acidity and a hard- edged structure. Of course it will soften, but this will likely remain a tannic wine, the fruit always edged with acidity, for many years. It is potentially a great wine that just needs patience.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This shows the proper attention to structure that is the inheritance of any Nuits-Saint-Georges.

It is on the sweet side of Pinot Noir, jammy with red berry flavors, and already delicious.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fontanafredda is a landmark estate for the entire winemaking area and this vintage of its lovely base Barolo is particularly delicious.

This is rich, smooth and powerful, and it will age for 10 years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from fruit sourced from a small premier cru that's located next to the famous Clos des Mouches, this is juicy, round and ripe, with a great swathe of soft, fleshy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich and smooth, this wine's structured tannins are fully integrated into its juicy fruit. It's a ripe bottling, and it shows a hint of wood aging in the form of a smoky character. The acidity is intense, which perks up the berry fruit. This promises to age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from Pepper Bridge Vineyard fruit, this rich, deep Malbec is similar to pricey Argentine versions. It matches concentrated black fruits to generous new barrel-derived flavors of vanilla, cinnamon and Kahlua. The acidity keeps the palate propped up through the long finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows bold oak tones of toast and spice that will unwind with 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 more years of bottle age. Beyond the notes of cinnamon and tobacco, this blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc shows austerity and complexity, with touches of dark plum and tangy barbecue sauce. Give it a few more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe, smooth and rich, this bears flavors of milk chocolate, blackberry jam, molasses and black licorice. The tannins are thick and supple, yet the mouthfeel remains firm. It finishes dry and spicy. This can be consumed now with roasted meat or beef stew.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It's important to not drink this Merlot right out of the bottle, because it's pretty tannic, and thus it's hard to appreciate the wine's beautiful fruit. Give it some time in a decanter to reveal the complex flavors of blackberry, cherry jam, grilled prosciutto, cassis, red licorice, cola and spice. It's unclear if this will age for a long time, but it can certainly be enjoyed over the next five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here is a lovely expression of Merlot from the up-and-coming Montescudaio zone, which is located on the Tuscan coast just north of Bolgheri. The wine shows immense softness, and it has a huge cherry flavor that has been shaped by spice and chocolate accents from 18 months in barrel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Velvety, with a touch of grit, this wine is tart and tangy in acidity, with a firmness of structure and tannin. The boldly interwoven flavors are defined by wild strawberry, cranberry and black tea.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, dried herb, raisin, saddle leather and balsamic aromas follow over to the ripe palate along with dried cherry, crushed herb and ground clove. Taut tightly wound tannins provide a grippy framework. Give the tannins a few years to unwind then drink to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intense aromas of chopped mint, new leather, prune and camphor take center stage. The palate is firmly structured, offering dried black cherry, clove and sage framed in grainy tannins that grip the finish. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of pressed rose petal, underbrush, truffle, white pepper and leather. The already approachable palate delivers juicy black cherry, cooking spice and licorice. Drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Juicy in red fruit, orange and rhubarb, this wine offers sizable body against a backbone of impressively balanced oak. Dry, firm tannins add to the strength and resonance of the palate, while subtle floral aromas lend intrigue to the bouquet.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the first vintage of this designated wine, grown on a high-elevation vineyard called William Wesley, near Annapolis. Cherry, raspberry and a touch of smoke create synergy around a medium-bodied core of soft, velvety texture and a crisp seasoning of white pepper.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dense, dark aromas of minty oak, blackberry, pencil lead and chocolate set up a broad, hard-bodied palate with firm, gripping tannins. Toasty blackberry and pronounced oak flavors culminate on a big, lush and grabby finish. This is excellent, though a bit bold and burly; drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: It opens with an earthy fragrance of black plum, underbrush, meat juices, thyme and bay leaf. The dense palate delivers juicy black cherry accented with licorice, black pepper and balsamic herbs. Big and concentrated, it has ripe tannins balanced by decent acidity. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932923.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and bold, this opens with aromas of baked plum, blue flowers and sweet baking spice.

Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With an opaque purple color and gritty, reduced aromas of grapy black fruits and hot stones, this hard, tannic, impermeable Tinto Fino tastes of lemony oak, baked blackberry and herbs. A dark, charred finish with notes of shoe polish and licorice is intense. Overall, this is fully extracted, concentrated and on the cusp of overdone. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of underbrush, tilled soil, toast and espresso lead the nose. The firmly structured palate offers ripe black cherry, blackberry, coffee, anise and grilled herb alongside assertive tannins that need to unwind. Drink 1016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak-heavy aromas of vanilla, graphite, blackberry and cassis come in front of a tannic, firm palate. Toasty blackberry aromas show a note of wood resin, while flavors of licorice and blackened toast ride high on a brisk finish. Drink this off-vintage Rioja through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lifted peach and chamomile just hint at the maturity of this wine that has barely begun its trajectory. The palate is still taut and firm, fresh with lemon zest and singing with an evolved, lifted purity. This does not need sweetness to propel its flavor: its slender poise and purity make it soar on its own. The more you taste, the more you find: drops of soy, glints of stone, shimmers of citrus and lanolin. It's gorgeous, concentrated, incisive and long.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Sangiovese, this stunning elegant wine is initially closed but then blooms in the glass to reveal red berry, iron, blue flower, underbrush and dark spice. The focused, radiant palate delivers bright cherry, star anise, white pepper and mineral alongside vibrant acidity and polished tannins. A hint of orange zest graces the lingering finish. Hold for more complexity. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft notes of honeysuckle hover over the waxy scent of fresh honeycomb. Meadow flowers gild those flavors with honest freshness. The palate holds a gentle softness, letting the honeyed, developed notes of this restrained Gewurztraminer convey both fir-honey bitterness and blossom-sweet ease. This shows supreme balance and seems young and fresh for an eight-year-old wine. It comes from a supreme, balanced and cool year that shows its mettle with age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a tiny spot near the town of Forestville, this vineyard-designate does justice to the special site, planted in Goldridge dirt to a variety of suitcase clones. Earth, sage and a persistence of exotic spice mark it first, inviting one in for further exploration of raspberry, cherry and a firmness of tannin. Concentrated, it's enjoyable now and yet should have years more to go in the bottle. Drink now through 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Spicy and fruity, this wine combines 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Malbec, 21% Cabernet Franc and 16% Petit Verdot. Blueberry and cassis make appearances, as do rich, full-bodied tannins and punches of oak. The finish delves into chocolate, tobacco and coffee in equal measure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a Freestone-based vineyard, Zephyr Farms is pungently earthy with a streak of mint, somewhat reduced in a cauldron of sour cherry and black tea. A swath of leather adds to the pungency of forest and concentrated spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rustic swagger of leather and earth mark the entry of this wine, a densely packed, thickly tannic expression of tobacco and blackberry pie. It is darkly effected by the 15% addition of Petit Verdot, as well as smaller proportions of Malbec and Syrah.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A soft, easygoing red wine that's dry and classically made, this is more on the full-bodied style than slim. Chalky tannins provide substantial texture alongside chocolate and pinches of pencil shavings, finished in blackberry pie.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of fragrant blue flower, perfumed berry, rose, baking spice and eucalyptus emerge in the glass. The medium-bodied palate offers raspberry compote, cranberry and cinnamon alongside tightly knit close-grained tannins that clench the finish. Drink after 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of asphalt, herb, cracked pepper and dark fruit lead to full-bodied fruit flavors. It sails on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, dried rose, aromatic herb and a balsamic note of menthol slowly take shape. The full-bodied palate offers French oak, licorice, espresso, raspberry jam and mint alongside aggressive, somewhat grainy, tannins that leave a bracing finish. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Piercing on the nose, with hickory smoke, char and exotic boysenberry aromas. Feels high in acid and low in density, with a tight and biting mouthfeel along with heavily oaked flavors of berry fruit, vanilla, butter and coconut. Very fresh and colorful, but lacking in stuffing and complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine is enormously ripe, a lip-smackingly fruity 100% Cab that seduces the palate with massive black currant, licorice, sweet date and cedar flavors. Yet it has a tannic astringency that suggests, although it does not require, aging. Should develop well for at least a decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Duckhorn has an absolutely consistent track record with this bottling from St. Helena, and there's no way they're stopping now. The 2004 is riper and softer than its predecessors, but no less rewarding. It shows elaborately ripe black currant, cherry, chocolate, cedar and violet flavors, and is very well oaked, just oozing vanilla caramel. Drink now or soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux blend is very delicious and very young. It combines ripe, plush cassis and cocoa fruit flavor with rich, fine tannins and fine acidity to produce a wine of extraordinary balance. Should develop effortlessly over the next decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Winemaker Victoria Benavides has maxed out the ripeness but has avoided any raisin, prune or molasses characteristics, which we like. Her Gran sits heavier on the palate than the 2004 Crianza, with firm tannins. But it also lingers more solidly on the back of the palate. To admire its purity and power, it's probably best to drink over the next four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The second wine of Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau Haut-Brion is firm, mirroring its grand vin. It is dark, brooding and dense, rounded by ripe fruits. There is also an edge of bitter chocolate that offers an intriguing counterpoint to the elegance of the fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tight and focused, this opens with aromas of wild berry, red rose, culinary spice and a whisper of menthol. Chiseled and austere, the palate offers sour cherry, pomegranate, white pepper and a hint of anise. Youthfully assertive fine-grained tannins and bright acidity provide the framework. Give it time to soften and fully develop. Drink 2023\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932033.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red berry, blue flower and tilled soil lead the way on this young elegant wine. The fresh tightly wound palate shows cherry, licorice, sage and an iron note set against close-knit tannins. It's still youthfully austere so give it time to come around. Drink 2020\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932031.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine opens in a depth of compostable earth and leathery smoke, unleashing a bold, big-boned body of tannin and oaky weight as it expands on the palate. Juicy, it releases aromas of violets within the more robust waves of flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brooding aromas of herb, dark fruit and spice lead to full bodied cranberry and cherry flavors that bring a lot of oomph. It's a delicious example of the variety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The vineyard lies just below the great white Grand Cru vines. It has something of the same power although in a more immediately approachable style. The fruit is juicy, crisp, open with generous white stone fruits and a lively line of citrus acidity. Drink this beautifully balanced wine from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Low-yielding old vines have produced this perfumed wine. Along with the fragrance, it has a tannic structure, layers of acidity and red fruits that are gently maturing. The wine is dense, with rare concentration for a red Sancerre, while the aftertaste balances acidity and fruitiness. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Splashes of high acidity and contoured minerality mark this estate-grown wine with a sinewy, fresh palate that's inviting and exotic. The defining characteristics are a pleasant mix of roses, soy and forest floor. Dark cherry and pomegranate lie beneath the more savory aspects, ultimately leaving one with an appreciation for how velvety a wine can be.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Silencieux is the winemaker's showcase of five distinct vineyards, blended together into a seamless whole. The sites span from Calistoga through Rutherford to cooler Coombsville and Pope Valley, combining to offer chocolatey plum and red cherry, with the head-turning ability to be both bright and decadent simultaneously. Integrated tannin keeps the texture fresh on the palate, with a lingering waft of anise. Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a historic site planted in 1903, Hayne is perfumed in cherry and raspberry, full-bodied no doubt, yet subtle and nuanced in its plushy complexity and soft structure. Strong on the palate, with a tiny sprinkling of black pepper, it offers length and breadth that suggests further aging. Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wild berry, red rose, baking spice and a balsamic note meld together in the glass. The structured, savory palate doles out juicy wild cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, cinnamon and tobacco. Bracing but refined tannins provide the framework. Drink 2018 through 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a 29-acre property separate from the estate, this wine, made by the Saint-Maur team, benefits from the cool, 1,200-foot elevation that bestows a crisp, elegant character. It comes in an overweight statement bottle, four inches across at the base. Fortunately the wine is delicious, lightly perfumed and full of tantalizing white-peach flavors with a mineral structure that comes from schist soil. Age for a few more months and drink from late 2016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The herb, violet, red fruit and mineral aromas start out light, with earth, smoked meat and black pepper notes lurking in the background. The fruit and savory flavors coat the palate with a pillowy soft texture, displaying an exquisite sense of balance. It's hard to put the glass down but a grilled peppercorn steak pairing demands it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a smoky, dusty 100% varietal wine from a tremendous vineyard site in the wilds of Howell Mountain. Sage and forest floor combine around a wall of structured, polished tannin. Dried herbs, leather and black currant accent the full body and wealth of concentration. Cellar through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak. Juicy waves of cassis and red currant are accented by dark chocolate, ultimately showcasing a lush, plush yet structured palate. It's decadent now, but should age well through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Tobacco leaf, new leather, forest floor and blackberry open the nose of this nicely ruby-colored Brunello di Montalcino. This wine delivers aromas of cedar wood, vanilla seed, black fruit and exotic spice. In the mouth, it is bright and tonic with sweet oak or cherry fruit flavors on the close. It's almost ready to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a thick and opulent Brunello Riserva with a pleasurable and forward style that puts emphasis on intensity, quality of fruit and texture. The wine boasts a dark garnet color with aromas that span from exotic spice to pressed flowers. It needs at least five more years of cellar aging because the tannins are still a bit young.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a harmonious and attractive Brunello Riserva with elegant tones of spice, cola, black stone and forest fruit. The wine has excellent texture and consistency and fills your mouth with bright berry tones. Piccini is an important name in Chianti Classico and has recently added hearty Brunello to its portfolio.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose on this bottling is a bit reserved at first, with a touch of tar and beef char as well as black-cherry syrup. The acidity and tannins are there in judicious amounts on the palate, but the flavors remain a tad hidden, with just hints of blueberry and pepper poking out.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tobacco, brown sugar, dried fruit and vanilla aromas work the bouquet, which is very nice. In the mouth, however, it's acidic, almost to the point of being citrusy. Flavors of earthy sour plum and raspberry are propped up by lasting acids, while the palate teeters on lemony and shear. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red Chassagne-Montrachet used to be found more than white in the past. This wine has a ripe, earthy character that brings out structure and tannin as well as strawberry fruits. It has a juicy as well as smoky character with spice and solid tannins in the background. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leather, truffle and ripe black plum aromas lead the nose. The fleshy palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed blackberry, licorice and clove while robust, polished tannins give it a smooth, enveloping texture. It's already at its peak drinking window so enjoy soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, thick and blended with 10% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Sauvignon, this dual-county red is high in ripeness and tannin, well representing the vintage in terms of enviable structure, as well. Leathery earth and juicy black currant are tempered by dried herb. Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truffle, leather, berry, grilled herb, oak and a whiff of game lead the nose. The dense, taut palate doles out Morello cherry, raspberry compote, baking spice and a hint of pipe tobacco alongside close-grained tannins. A bitter sage note closes the firm finish. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a soft, round wine, made mostly of Merlot, with smaller amounts of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Dry, grippy tannins provide a bulkhead of structure that supports black pepper, currant, cedar and clove.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, sunbaked soil, toast, and espresso aromas come together in the glass. The structured, tightly wound palate shows star anise, dried black cherry and a note of powdered sage with bracing tannins that grip the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of menthol, blue flower and dark berry lift out of the glass. The tannic palate is still primary, offering tart sour cherry and star anise while a hint of dried sage closes the firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Given ample time in oak, this wine delivers size and strength, a feisty celebration of big blackberry fruit and muscular tannins, well representative of both the vineyard and the vintage. Strawberry, mushroom and truffle figure prominently, with a finish of black tea.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A late-harvest blend of Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay and S\\u00c3\\u00a9millon from a good year for botrytis, this is dark gold in color. It offers sweet, lush and satisfying swaths of dried apple and orange that linger on the palate, finished with a drop of honey.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Named for a small family property in the south of France, this wine is all about small production and small lots. Fruit is sourced from the grand Klopp Thorn Ridge Ranch. Slightly cloudy, the wine is powerful and concentrated in oak at first, followed by ripe, bright approachable red fruit. Give it through 2020 to get even better.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This luminous, garnet-colored wine opens with aromas that recall underbrush, earth, toast, red berry and hint of menthol. A framework of refined tannins support juicy red berry, mocha and baking spice flavors. It's already very accessible and should be enjoyed over the next few years. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A 100% varietal wine aged more than two years in French oak, this is earthy and rustically unfussy, offering a structure of integrated tannin that shades shy fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, scorched earth, espresso and exotic spice aromas open. The taut, linear palate offers dried sour cherry, coffee bean and grilled sage alongside a backbone of austere, fine-grained tannins that leave a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blue flower, baked plum, vanilla and a whiff of resin lead the nose. The juicy, straightforward palate offers dried sour cherry, cranberry, anise and a hint of white pepper alongside fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Barolo has typical varietal aromas of rose and a hint of leather, but shows the heat of the 2007 vintage in its overripe black fruit and spice accompanied by a warm midpalate. The finish is abrupt, marked by bitter, green tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bottling from Napa veteran St. Clement has been variable in recent years. The '05 is similar to the '02. It's a likeable, elegant Cab that drinks well now. The cherry, blackberry, plum and mocha flavors are wrapped into rich, soft tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a firm wine that is structured with dense tannins. At the same time, its ripe black fruits and acidity promise a generous rich future. From a walled vineyard, once belonging to the local bishop, the wine is set for some long-term aging. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wood-aged and structured wine is concentrated and dense. It comes from the Premier Cru vineyard just to the west of the village.

Drink from 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This small Premier Cru vineyard is wholly owned by the Devillard family. It is a rich wine, boasting layers of beautiful jammy red fruits and just the lightest touch of wood. Tannins are there, forming a core that will stand the wine in good stead as it ages. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Unabashed in its alcohol levels, but not really boozy in any overdone way, this bottling offers very fresh, juicy and boisterous aromas of violet, candied blueberry, asphalt and pepper on the nose. The palate also starts with ripe blackberry and blueberry then grows more serious with grippy tannins and a zingy acidity. Dark chocolate and charred meat show in the midpalate.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The wine is tight with a strong mineral element over the acidity. It shows a sense of chalky terroir, full of red-currant fruits and a nervy aftertaste. It will take some time to fully develop, so wait until 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe rounded wine, backed by the firm tannins that mark Pommard. It is bold, ripe with plenty of concentrated red fruits and finishing acidity. The wine has a crisp edge that lifts the tannins. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Foresty berry aromas come with a whack of charred wood. In the mouth, this wine is rugged and loaded with intensity and acidity.

The wine is likely to age well, ready to drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Crisp apple and lemon are lurking within creamy wallops of oak, making this a pleasant-enough wine. The ripeness and butter make for curious companions given the bitterly tart, sour finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Espresso, toast, new leather, menthol and French oak aromas take center stage. The firm palate offers juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and sage alongside tightly knit fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The Gonet family's investment, which began in 1998, has begun to bear fruit.

This is just coming together after a quiet period for the vintage. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This fragrant wine will entice with you its heady perfume of woodland berry, wild herb, graphite and blue flower.

Drink through 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coming from one of the strongest vintages of the last decade and with a full five years in bottle, this blend of Pepper Bridge (60%) and Minnick Hills fruit brings aromas of smoke, barrel spice, cranberry, cherry and dark berry.

It brings a sense of hedonism and balance that is impossible to ignore.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Robustly spicy in cardamom and cinnamon cola, this wine explodes in dark berry fruit, its medium-bodied layers smoothed and velvety on the palate. From one of the more prominent sites within the Petaluma Gap's wind tunnel, this wine has a coastal influence of salty air about it.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a recently planted area of valley, high on a ridge top. A blend of 56% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot, 6% Cabernet Franc and 6% Malbec, the aromas boast high-toned notes of mineral, herb, cherry, licorice and dark fruit. The cranberry and cherry flavors bring a sense of concentration and richness.

It will not improve with further aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is an absolutely beautiful wine to drink now, but the richness comes at the price of considerable alcohol. The color is dark and impenetrable, the aromas huge in Cabernet-inspired blackberries and black currants, with a touch of something herbal and also a stony minerality. There's also a fascinating peatiness, like an Islay Scotch. It really opens up in the glass, becoming ever more complex. It's great Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, but that high alcohol may limit its ageability.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There are incredible aromatics on this Cabernet. It's powerful yet subtle (how can that be?), all about sweet, crushed summer blackberries and pure cassis liqueur. Elaborate oak, in the form of buttered toast, is perfectly in balance, never overshadowing the fruit. The tannins are dry, rich and smooth, defining Napa elegance, grace and beauty. World class, dramatic and just about perfect, this gets better and better as it breathes in the glass. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932030.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With a beautiful purple color, this wine quickly exhibits classic Cabernet aromas of black currants and cedar.

But you really want to restrain that impulse and give it some time in the cellar. Blended from roughly equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's dry and tannic, but with a molten core of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise and sweet new oak. Very fine, very elaborate and complex. Give it 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years, at least.

Ripe, almost jammy flavors coat the tongue, and vibrate with black currant on the finish. Fine-grained tannins give the texture lots of grip, and support the ripe fruit flavors so they stay dry and appetizing sip after sip.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Offering some of the few relatively good-value wines from Pauillac, this 50-acre property has made an impressive wine in this tough year. It is structured and dense although the black-currant fruitiness shows that it will develop quickly to be drinkable from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine comes from a densely planted seven-acre estate, typical of many small properties in Pomerol.

Aggressive tannins leave an astringent, tongue-drying close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mature black-skinned fruit, raisin, leather and a hint of menthol come together on this structured wine.

The one-dimensional palate delivers concentrated black cherry, raspberry, cracked white pepper and a hint of mocha alongside chewy tannins and the warmth of alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with 100% Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of new wood, roasted coffee bean and menthol. The tired palate offers oak-driven spice and coconut but the fruit has completely dried up, leaving only evident alcohol and bitterly astringent tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a succulent wine, with juicy red fruits and a fine structure that gives the wine its texture. Balanced and ready to drink, the wine (which is made in tiny quantities) is a fine mature Bordeaux.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, this opulent wine evokes black currant, underbrush and vanilla on the nose.

Its firm palate offers dried cherry, licorice and espresso flavors framed by close-grained tannins and vibrant acidity. It has structure but lacks fruit richness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a gorgeously luxurious wine, vibrant and alive in blackberry and raspberry, a savory lining of red currant providing its edge. The big tannin presence speaks to cellaring, through 2022, but a decant should help, too, allowing the herbal and fruit components to come into balance with its powerful density.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Given extra time in the bottle, this wine combines a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, aged entirely in French oak. The entry is sanguine and generous in red currant and denser blackberry, while elements of thyme lurk on the back of the palate. While the tannins remain sizable, they're silky, and should take on additional plushness in time. Cellar through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Jordan Fiorentini continues to knock socks off with powerful wines, even when led by Grenache, which comprises 55% of this blend along with 27% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre and 18% Syrah. Dark raspberries, smashed strawberries, concentrated rose petals, soy and beef jerky lead into energetic flavors of olallieberry, black-slate minerality and blueberry-skin tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alluring aromas of pressed violet, iris, perfumed berry, tilled soil and a whiff of leather show tremendous class and pedigree. On the structured but elegant palate, notes of tobacco, anise, chopped mint and clove back up the core of crushed black cherry, while assertive, fine-grained tannins provide the backbone.

Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a round, rich and soft style of Chardonnay. It feels generous, and its yellow fruit flavor pushes through the acidity. It slowly opens to reveal complex tropical-fruit notes, and it will develop further, so give it another four years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a rich, rounded wine, yet it also expresses a tight texture and nervy acidity. The toast influence is still dominating, although the fruitiness of this ripe selection is also showing. With its weight and structure, this is a prime candidate to age for several years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has delicious red-fruit nuances that are backed by espresso, spice and leather tones. There's a meaty, savory quality that would pair well with breaded veal or lasagna. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A rich, spicy wine, this shows flavors of new wood and ripe yellow fruit. The concentrated palate reveals juicy pear and peach juice flavors and a tight, minerally structure. Dense vineyard planting and 35-year-old vines bring out extra intensity and complexity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is one of the most successful Syrah-Cabernet Franc blends in California. The Syrah brings blueberry and bacon flavors, and the Cabernet provides the black currant note and the tannic backbone. It's already delicious to drink, but allow it to breathe in a decanter for one or two hours.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With its firm tannins and structure, this is a wine that's made in the traditional Nuits-St.-Georges style.

Oak-derived aromas of toasted almond and clove are delicate and well integrated.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a wood-aged style of Chablis, but the toast has been applied discreetly.

It's long and seamless.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A sweet cherry aroma sets the scene for this fruity, firmly structured wine. The juicy red-berry fruit is balanced by a smoky tannic character. This will be a pleasure to drink in a year, and it can also age longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Enticing aromas of fresh violet, blackberry jam, cake spice and a whiff of new leather jump out of the glass. On the structured polished palate, velvety tannins frame dried black cherry, prune, chewing tobacco and mocha.

The warm, forward palate offers dense black cherry, espresso and alpine herbs alongside a solid tannic backbone.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with aromas of black berry fruit along with more rustic notes of game and a whiff of barnyard. The palate offers up crushed black cherry, toast, black pepper, espresso and vanilla alongside oak extract. The brooding, astringent tannins need time to integrate fully. Drink after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This shows dense notes of plum and cedar, with firm, sizable tannin. The body and ripeness mark the vintage but find balance within a structure of subtle oak.

Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from a separate parcel of the Valandraud estate, this is a fruity, ripe wine.

The alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.5%. The flavors are of black currants, cassis, softened cola and leather, with plenty of peppery spices. Should hold in the bottle for a few years, but fine to drink now, after a few hours of decanting to let it breathe.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, herb and woodland berry aromas take center stage in this fragrant red. The full-bodied palate deals morello cherry, cranberry and licorice, alongside firm, refined tannins. Drink through 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932023.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A racy wine, juicy, fresh and fruity. The lively red fruits are totally dominant. There is structure, but it is the delicious fruit that speaks.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The first mouthful reveals a wine that is just plain opulent and rich. Only on the second taste do dense tannins push their way in, a structure that is concentrated, dry and tight. The fruit flavors are also forward, strawberry juice touched with cranberry juice dryness. This could age well, give it 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Solid and concentrated, this wine initially is tight, showing minerality as well as rich fruit. The dark tannins then open to reveal sweetness, ripe strawberry jelly as well as soft acidity and licorice. A big wine that will evolve over the next several years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With smoky aromas, this starts out as an enticing wine. On the palate, the fruit is surprisingly soft for a Nuits-St-Georges, with the wine's evident structure showing an open character, edged with wood and red plum and currant flavors. The dry tannins give shape, but do not dominate this big wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Heidi Barrett's estate vineyard in Calistoga, this Syrah is very rich and appealing. What it lacks in complex subtlety it makes up for in immediate chocolate-inspired blackberry jam and mushu plum flavors. Firmly tannic, it might age for a while, but will show best now through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big, tannic and foursquare, this is archetypal Pommard. The dark plum and black fig flavors and the rich tannins all contribute to a wine that is solid, concentrated, dense and needs at least four years' aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Raspberries with hints of cranberry dominate this juicy but structured wine. This is a wine that shows a very elegant style, certainly not forceful, but deliciously direct.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very ripe, rich and fruity, showing powerful blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors.

Floral and spicy, it remains elegant on the palate and will take on additional nuance in the cellar. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A tiny-production wine made to honor the legacy of Jimmy Valvano, this Cab is huge, leathery and possibly not for everyone. For those who do like a complexity of funk, this one delivers, with a massive mouthfeel of minerality, finished in black licorice and chocolate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Guava-glazed beef ribs, smoky teriyaki, black peppercorns and black cherry fruit swirl into a luxurious nose on this lush wine by Michael Mooney.

Hold through 2013, then drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The 2006 Pertimali tastes better than the 2006 Riserva and the 2007 Brunello.

Structured and firm, the wine delivers a clean, focused feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The purity of fruit is the most striking aspect of this wine. While it is relatively light in texture, it revels in its fresh red-fruited character that gives an impressive intensity. With balanced touches of tannin and acidity, the wine should age well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bramble and forest floor, cherry cola and savory bresaola notes amount to pretty aromatics with less bulkiness in the mouth. The structure is there but this wine is a bit dry, sharp and less fleshy than many others.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: What a beauty! Masculine aromas of black fruits, cola and oak sit there begging to be sipped, while the lush, deep palate is home to dense blackberry, cassis and chocolate flavors.

Sure, it's a structured, tannic wine but its fine texture helps make it approachable within the next five years or so.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's an expression of Nebbiolo from the celebrated Bussia cru that opens with juicy fruit tones of cherry and blackberry backed by charred notes of campfire, cured beef, cigar box, leather and crushed granite. The tannins here boast a very polished, almost squeaky quality.

There are some earthy, dusty tones on the finish and the wine imparts firm, ripe tannins in the mouth. Riservas are usually aged one more year than base Barolos.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bernardot is a bold and plump expression of Barbaresco with soft, ripe tannins and expressive aromatic layers of cherry, plum, prune and new leather. The elegance and detailed nature of Nebbiolo shines through but the emphasis here is on opulence and richness overall.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a rich and densely extracted Barbaresco from the Erte vineyard in Neive that will appeal to those who like a bigger, more extracted style of Nebbiolo. The wine is bursting with intense layers of black fruit, prune and plum followed by sweet tones of exotic spice. The mouthfeel is chewy, tart and very firm.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blueberry, blackberry, toast, spice and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this blend of 50% Cabernet, 40% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot. The evolved palate offers prune, raisin, cocoa, espresso and cedar alongside fleeting tannins. Most of the fruit has dried up, giving it a lean quality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plum cake, leather, cocoa, eucalyptus, and exotic spice slowly take shape. The firm palate offers dried black currant, raisin, leather, licorice, mocha and sage alongside tightly knit, close-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Baked plum, crushed violet, chewing tobacco and roasted coffee bean aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied red.

A strong sense of structure partners with a steely core and mineral texture that firms up the fruit and promises aging. Drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Impressively rich, this is smooth, dense and opulent in its concentration. It's full both of fresh acidity and toasty rich flavors that fill the mouth. The background is the steely texture that gives the wine a fine bite at this young stage. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Already beautiful, this comes from an estate that's managed by Louis Jadot in Puligny-Montrachet, always producing fine wines. It's smooth and toasty, although it is already showing ripe yellow fruits and fragrant acidity. Although drinkable now, it really needs to age, so keep until 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A Sonoma Coast vineyard in Annapolis, only four miles from the ocean, Ellenbach sits atop Goldridge soils, an unusual attribute for the area. High in acidity, this wine is grippy and floral, with an enviable presence of power and elegance on the palate. Red fruit shines brightest, from cranberry to wild raspberry.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is ripe, full of yellow fruits and soft acidity. It's creamy and ripe, but cut with orange zest and a mineral texture. It will be ready to drink from 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light, clear and varietal, this ripe, full-bodied wine is balanced by a seasoning of forest floor, Christmas spice and cranberry-orange. The fruit is elusive against the toasty oak and integrated tannin.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: You'll discover aromas of menthol, dark baking spice and a hint of leather on this firmly structured red.

On the full-bodied palate, notes of espresso, mocha and vanilla add depth to the black cherry core. Firm tannins provide the framework.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Classic Nebbiolo scents of rose, violet ripe berry and a hint of baking spice come together on this. The straightforward, approachable palate offers black cherry, coffee and clove alongside velvety tannins.

A raisin note closes the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sporting a lovely front label, this holds a mix of Syrah and Petite Sirah from Rutherford with Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot. The wine is a bit muddled, one-dimensional in plum and black cherry, and ultimately softly simple.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Roasted, toasty aromas are the greeting on this Tempranillo-based blend (20% Cabernet). It's a fresh yet oaky type of Rioja, with resiny creaminess cut by lively acidity. Flavors of vanilla, plum, raspberry and tobacco are traditional, while the finish is mild, crisp and snappy. Hold until 2014 and drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine bursts open with vibrant tones of sweet cherry and forest berry followed by cola and a touch of fruit liqueur. The wine is easy and fresh but also shows the depth and intensity that link it to its celebrated siblings in the greater Brunello family.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of moist earth, black fruit, pencil lead and slightly overripe red apple are followed by a firm palate backed by lightly grippy tannins. This wine needs some food to keep them in check.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The golden hue promises flavors of development. A clearly advanced nose brims with notes of dark, bitter fir honey, chalky stone and dried currant fruit, while the palate holds honey, stone and bright, sprightly citrus. The poles of Pinot Gris richness and Alsace acidity are brought to a wonderful counterpoint. It finishes rich with lemon freshness, gingerbread and bitter almond.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gentle, aromatic notes of ripe apricot appear first, followed by a little smoke. The palate comes in like a clarion call of lemony, brisk, citric freshness. This wine is streamlined and crystal clear, with a defined outline and a stony, concentrated core. With all its power it is muscular but suave and ultraclean.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Hints of flinty smoke precede notes of ripe pear fruit on the nose. The palate comes with an unusually light-footed, almost fleeting transparency. Instead of weight there is depth and promise with a citrus-scented core that wants to be plumbed and explored. There are hints of almond and gingerbread spice that frame this lovely, slender, dry and spicy Pinot Gris with its clean finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From a hillside vineyard near Moon Mountain overlooking the Sonoma Valley, this wine was blended with 5% Petite Sirah. While not as high in alcohol as some of the producer's other wines, it has a concentrated character on the palate, akin to blueberry syrup, with soft, moderate tannins and a dusty texture. Red and black cherry provide additional fruit flavor.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This blend of 50% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, 38% Syrah and 12% Grenache is fairly light on the nose, showing smoked beef, soy and black-plum paste. The flavors are also quite restrained, with leather, blackberry, fennel and wild-mint elements.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Although this is from the Sonoma Coast appellation, it's high elevation, so the vineyard is often above the fog that plagues the lower Russian River Valley. As a result, the wine is quite ripe and forward in jammy raspberries, cherries, licorice and cola. New French oak adds the usual smoky, vanilla accents.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This vintage of Tenuta di Trinoro's renowned super Tuscan (mostly Merlot with some Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Canernet Sauvignon) is a tad too ripe and mature to score higher. Bold notes of strawberry and blackberry preserves rob the wine of some of its inherent elegance and add a chewy, sticky element to its mouthfeel. Otherwise, you'll get bold tones of tobacco, leather and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very ripe, with powerful grilled blackberry, cassis and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into strong tannins. The large vineyard is up on Atlas Peak, and the wine shows the slightly rustic, pugnacious quality that can mark Cabs of the appellation. Give it a few years to mellow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Warm and robust, this full-bodied Barolo offers aromas of underbrush, scorched earth, tar and kirsch. The palate is bold and hearty but also shows the heat of the vintage, doling out cherry-marinated-in-spirits, licorice and clove alongside almost scorching alcohol. Drink sooner rather than later.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Baking spice, dried flower, dark-skinned berry and a whiff of coconut lead the nose on this straightforward Barolo. The firm palate offers dried black cherry, toast and vanilla alongside firm, tightly knit tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This offers aromas of pressed rose, cherry marinated in spirits, aromatic herb and menthol. The bracing palate shows raw red cherry, clove, white pepper and a hint of mocha while assertive tannins and racy acidity provide the framework. It's still young and aggressively tannic so don't attempt before 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a muddled or confused quality to this blend of Sangiovese (50%), Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. Although the nose needs deciphering, the mouthfeel is clean, fruit-driven and tight.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This vintage of Volpaiole's (Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot) shows a fresh or unripe note of green pepper and rosemary. Ultimately, there is more dimension here compared to 2006.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This has subdued aromas suggesting aromatic herb, forest floor, truffle and a whiff of leather. It's assertive and rather lean in terms of fruit richness, displaying sour cherry, pomegranate, espresso, clove and a note of powdered sage. Tight, grainy tannins leave a firm finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Under new winemaking and vineyard protocols, this producer is working with estate-grown fruit across all its wines. This one shows a rich, rounded approach that never gets overly ripe, instead embracing a sanguine, savory profile of cranberry and red currant wrapped in toasted oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vibrant, complex aromas of grilled asparagus, ember, tapenade, fresh herb, potpourri and moist earth lead to full abundant palate-coating fruit and savory flavors. It shows a very pretty sense of styling along with impeccable balance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Firm and bright, this is a full-bodied, generously layered red rich in red currant, tobacco, clove and black pepper. Lengthy and complexly woven, it has a gravelly edge of minerality to its texture and taste.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Softened and given additional color from the addition of 7% Malbec, this is a beautiful, herbaceous wine, etched in cassis and cedar. Structured, it offers subtle, nuanced oak behind its density of sage and dusty earth, a worthy expression of the vineyard atop Atlas Peak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Barrel fermentation and aging have given this wine its ripe character. They have filled it out with spiciness, adding complexity to the yellow fruit and maturing acidity. It's not going to age much further but is very fine to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the top vineyard sites in Sancerre, this fine wine is ripe, herby and intense. It has concentrated white fruits, citrus and green herbs. There is a distinct tangy minerality that will soften over the next few months. Drink from early 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon opens with ripe black currant, cedar and bell pepper scents. On the palate, expect concentrated dried Marasca cherry, tobacco and licorice flavors buttressed by firm, fine-grained tannins. Drink through 2027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Intriguing layers of light fruits like persimmon, raspberry and spice create a fine balance with the light body, the mild tannins and the elegant texture of this idiosyncratic coastal wine. Precise and somewhat reserved, the wine gives a sense of keeping its power and depth hidden until it's more mature. Best after 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This serious wine is spicy both from wood aging and from the natural character of the Cabernet Franc. It is rich, intense and with layers of red fruits balanced with a strongly smoky character. The wine has a tight texture, suggesting it needs further aging. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a nicely fragrant Rosso that shows bright nuances of raspberry, wild strawberry and pressed rose petal. The wine is smooth and silky to the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From Montalcino's most historic estate, this pretty Rosso opens with a bright, ruby color and aromas of spice and forest fruit. It delivers bright acidity and silky tannins in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Milk chocolate and sweet cherry aromas appear alongside cured meat and plump black fruit. This is a straightforward Brunello with a creamy, soft close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak. In the mouth, it's pure Cabernet pleasure, with soft, compelling tannins and fine acidity. It's a dramatic wine that should develop well over the next 10 years, if not longer. This is a winery to watch.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a beautiful interpretation from the 2008 vintage that shows balance, harmony and intensity all zipped up into one tight package. That seamless integration, followed by rich extraction, gives the wine momentum overall. Although this is a different wine from past vintages, the quality is just as high. Hold 5\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Austere and severe, this single-vineyard wine is very much a product of its limestone terroir.

Firm and structured, this is a wine for the long term.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This impressive Brunello Riserva opens with an inky, garnet color, gorgeous aromatic intensity and bright tones of red cherry, licorice, rum cake and menthol.

The wine can be cellared or consumed in two to three years from now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Both rich and dense, this wine shows the ripeness of the Merlot in 2010. It has firm fruit, touches of dark chocolate and licorice. With its concentration, this small vineyard is now in good form, producing ageworthy wines.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a lovely wine with savory notes of spice and leather backed by clean berry freshness and bright menthol. The wine is dark and sophisticated with a generous mouthfeel and soft, velvety tannins. It shows a brawny, masculine personality that would pair well with game hen with black truffle.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a meaty and masculine wine that is ready to drink now or within the next two to three years. It shows tight yet savory aromas of cured meat and spice followed by dried berry and cassis.

Nothing subtle here, just tiers of complexity, power and sheer lusciousness. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine shows its warm, sunny Napa origins through its incredible concentration of fruit. Don't look for subtlety here. It's the power of blackberries, currants and chocolate that impresses, as well as the penetrating quality of the tannins. Will age beautifully over the next 12\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 years, but it's so good now, you might be tempted to pop the cork.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here's a home run from one of the best producers in Montalcino. With sun drenched, sea-facing vineyards (this is one of the only spots where you can see the shimmering Mediterranean from Montalcino), this dense riserva doles out lingering flavors of spice, cherry, leather and tobacco. The acidity is perfectly balanced against the wine's soft fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A flashy wine\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094dry and rich and dense\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094 that manages to be drinkable now, yet also ageable. The flamboyant black currant, chocolate, spice and oak flavors are delicious, and while the tannins are pretty strong, they're finely ground, giving the wine a nice grittiness. This blend will age well through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Riserva La Poderina presents an impenetrable wall of aromatic intensity with dark concentration and lovely density in the mouth.

The inky color is dark and daunting, but the wine is actually more nuanced and elegant than you'd expect, with balanced acidity and fine tannins.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big-boned wine, showy in spearmint and eucalyptus, burly blackberry and tar. With integrated oak and tannin, it presents a respectable showing of approachably lush texture and succulence, the finish persistent in juicy fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Named after the winemaker's newborn son, Enzo is a bold unabashedly unique take on Finger Lakes Riesling in the hands of a Long Island producer. Made from grapes frozen on the vine and fermented via indigenous yeast in French oak, it's intensely spicy, wafting of caramel and candied orange rinds. The palate is unctuously honeyed but dusted by layers of earth and mineral. It's a far departure from a classic ice wine yet intriguingly complex and impeccably balanced.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dried herb and sage provide aromatic complexity before this full, generously styled wine takes on deeper, richer flavors of boysenberry, graphite and cedar. Soft oak and tannin provide approachability amid moderate structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: You'll find aromas of French oak, coconut, exotic spice and menthol on this brawny red.

Tons of crushed thyme, dill and green peppercorns surge on the spicy palate, laid across a backbone of plush red fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Leathery, clipped, briary black-fruit aromas are heavily oaked and smoky. This feels like a bag of nails, with a sucking texture. Barrel-heavy flavors of charred blackberry and cassis are resiny and dry, with clove notes and pounding tannins. Hold as long as you wish; this can only benefit from more time in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a masterpiece Sangiovese (with 15% Malvasia Nera) that shows a plush, rich nature and loads of fruity aromatic intensity. The wine is smooth, penetrating and long-lasting.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Owned by an expat artist/writer couple, M\\u00c3\\u00a1t\\u00c3\\u00a9 shows a great evolution of style and grace over the past years. This 2006 Brunello straddles modernity and tradition with a playful juxtaposition of wild berry and raspberry aromas against vanilla, clove and cinnamon spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Campogiovanni is a rich, inky expression of Sangiovese Grosso with beautiful personality and length. The mouthfeel is still young and raw but the aromas already show deep evolution and harmony. You'll recognize tones of red cherry, root beer, mesquite and Indian spice.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon and aged in mostly new French oak, this is a very elaborate wine. It's quite good, a full-bodied, powerful Cab with a molten core of blackberries and black currants and, of course, a thick, dry layer of firm tannins. It does not seem to have quite the depth of vintages from certain earlier vintages, but it should develop nicely in the cellar over the next decade or longer.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Held back for four-plus years before release, this Bordeaux blend has become softly gentle and approachable. It's rich in cherry, raspberry and cassis flavors, with a gorgeous, plump coating of sweet, toasted oak. Drink over the next five years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of Montalcino's historic estates, Camigliano's Brunello opens with attractive darkness and a smooth texture.

In the mouth, the wine shows enormous elegance and a silky, streamlined feel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Riserva Brunello delivers savory, brambly characteristics of moist earth and pressed blue flowers backed by forest berry and black cherry flavors. The mouthfeel is compact and clean with crisp acidity on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Brunello Fossacolle opens with a darkly concentrated color and aromas of tobacco, spice, chocolate and meaty, pulpy black fruit. The wine presents a bigger, inky style and shows good depth and density on the palate thanks to its extracted consistency, creaminess and overall intensity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Feels awkward in the mouth now, with hard tannins and tart acids. However, it has an attractive richness of blackberries and cassis, enhanced with rich oak. It's a classically youthful Cabernet that should develop with 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00935 years in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots of spice, leather and cherry character. Intense on the palate with mixed berry and violet flavors. Medium bodied, with fresh acidity on the medium finish and chewy tannins. Best after 2010.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coming from a cool vintage, this thriller of a wine has generous notes of black pepper, plum, orange rind and cranberry. It's concentrated, rich and flavorful with the oak (50% new French) giving some gruffness to the tannins that should soften with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Named after the New York City neighborhood where owner Jack Messina's ancestors first immigrated, this blend of 55% Syrah, 27% Grenache, 17% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre and a half-percent each of Viognier and Roussanne hits the nose with notes of violet, mocha, black cherry, slate and coffee. The tannins are mouthcoating, yet allow tart flavors of cherry and boysenberry to pass through, boosted by smoke and licorice on the edges. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Well-made and dancing in acidity, this Cabernet is juicy in notes of red currant and pomegranate, yet slightly exotic on the back palate, with hints of cardamom and cinnamon. Layered without being overly concentrated, the wine is built to age like its bigger brother (the Family Reserve), able to hold on and build nuance through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The color of this blend of 76% Chardonnay and 24% Pinot Noir is a rich, golden pink. It's medium-bodied and rich in toast, strawberry and lime flavors that finish a little sweet. The acidity is fabulous. Might develop bottle notes over the years, but why bother. It's a beautiful bubbly to drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Marked by oak and thick, dark blue fruit, this wine also conveys a buoyant softness and prettiness. The study in yin and yang characteristics starts with a bang and develops complexity in the glass.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aged for 36 months in barriques and 24 months in large casks, this opens with aromas of coconut, toasted oak and spicy blackberry.

Softened tannins and mellow oak combine to good effect, before an abbreviated finish of vanilla.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe fruit and oak mark this Cabernet Franc-dominated blend. That's both to its credit as well as a drawback. The wine is massive in cherry jam, currant and caramelized oak flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. But it's somewhat one-dimensional. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This dense wine has a strong sense of dry tannins as well as red-berry acidity.

The firm palate delivers dried black cherry, blackberry extract, licorice and tobacco alongside round, chewy tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sweet ripe fruit and sweet oak combine to make this Cabernet as rich and tasty as a dessert pastry. It's on par with recent vintages of Signorello Cabernet, an easy wine to like, but a bit lacking in dry substance. Probably best now.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An exceptional wine. Fragrant, with plenty of plum, black cherry, cedar and spice aromas.

Seamless and long, complex and forceful without being overpowering, it can stand alongside top tier Bordeaux costing four or five times as much.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine will divide aficionados. Some will find it too soft and fruity. Others will marvel at its sheer deliciousness. It's fantastically rich, a wine of deliriously decadent flavors, ranging from blackberry jam and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis to mocha, blueberry extract and buttered cinnamon toast. Yes, it's soft, but it's the softness of fine velvet. After all that richness, the finish is amazingly dry. Drink over the next few years to enjoy its youthful beauty.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There's always something magical about Gaja's Sor\\u00c3\\u00ac San Lorenzo. It's the intensity and fullness of the wine that penetrates to the back of the palate and offers many long minutes of persistency on the finish. The bouquet is redolent of black fruit, leather, spice, tar, licorice and dried herb.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A stunning wine with amazing intensity and a very distinct personality, this has aromas of ripe fruit, leather, tobacco, cola, dried ginger and cigar box.

Rich, enduring and persistent, it offers a long array of blackberry, spice and cola-like aromas.

Give this 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 more years of aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Petit Verdot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 7% Malbec and 7% Merlot. A masterpiece of blending, it has myriad pinpoint details, from the nose of flowers and berries, to the mouthfilling m\\u00c3\\u00a9lange of red and black fruits and finishing highlights of pepper and Asian spice. A precise, complex, elegant and powerful   Pentad with tremendous length, it represents the pinnacle of vintner Casey McClellan's 25 years of winemaking.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dominating aromas of smoky new wood follow through to the toasty flavor that covers the fruit at this stage. But, like all 2009s, this is a rich wine that will balance out and show all of its opulence. That said, it will likely always be a firm, ageworthy wine, with the dark tannins always in evidence.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A classic take on Merlot\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094this is 100% varietal, and was aged for 15 months in new and neutral French oak barrels and botti.

The midpalate is concentrated and full, with a fine, lingering, superclean finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An exciting flagship wine from one of the best producers in Piedmont, this is dark, inky and penetrating. It offers beautifully intense aromas of cassis, dried forest berry, ginger, cola, leather, and cedar. On the palate, it shows an incredibly silky and long quality. Hold for 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009320 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A tiny percentage of Barbera grapes accounts for why this famous wine is not labeled as a Barolo. The Nebbiolo is sourced from the Cerequio Cru and offers long aromas of dried fruit, licorice, tar, tobacco, bitter chocolate and cola. The finish is extremely fine and polished. Drink after 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Costa Russi presents a dark wall of ripe fruit and an exotic spice shading that give momentum and power to the finish. There are also notes of plum, dark chocolate, tobacco, licorice and tar. The quality of the tannins is firm and polished; this should evolve over many years to come.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Peat, flower, smoked meat and earthy funk aromas are at the fore. The flavors show a combination of richness and elegance, with smoked meat and olive brine flavors that linger.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lean on the entry in savory black tea and black pepper, this wine's soft, supple tannins belie a strong core of concentrated fruit and richness on the palate, that should become ever more intriguing through 2021. From a fantastic, cooler climate site near Sebastopol, this shows a feral quality that's entirely appealing here.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Blended with 4% Viognier, this is an attention-getting wine with aromas of black olive, nori, brown stems, smoked meat and blue fruit, unmistakably coming from The Rocks District. The layered, supple mouthfeel is where this wine truly struts its stuff with abundant blue fruit and savory flavors. It's a complete knockout.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of dark plum, sun-baked soil, cooking spice and grilled herb flow together in the glass. Made entirely with Sangiovese, the palate shows breeding and class, offering ripe black cherry, ground pepper, tobacco and aniseed alongside youthfully austere tannins. Give this time to fully develop. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the extreme wilds near Annapolis, this vineyard-designate is rapaciously earthy in all the right ways, a taste of its environs, sauvage and demanding. Dark cherry and blueberry exude on the nose and follow through on the palate, in between jolts of baking spice and dried herb. Medium bodied, the wine is on the money right now, but should also do well in the bottle for years to come.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a compelling wine with aromas of coffee, dried herbs, cherry and barrel spices. It wins over on finesse rather than power but shows more than ample amounts of both. There's enough structure that it will benefit from some time in the cellar. It will be best from 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This ripe wine comes from organic vineyards in the village of Brochon, next to Gevrey-Chambertin. It shows plenty of structure, a tantalizing smoky character from wood aging and juicy red fruit character. This will be a delicious wine to drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Small percentages of Merlot and Petit Verdot soften this robustly ripe red, hugely extracted in black currant and blackberry. Mocha, cigar smoke and leather saddle contribute a more muscular imprint, as a rounded weightiness holds on tenaciously to the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A scene of mushroom-filled forest is set aromatically in this estate-grown wine, rich in red fruit complemented in dried herb. Lean, with extracted tannins, it continues the thread of classic flavor in its grasp of pencil lead and tobacco.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Medium in body and high in acidity, this wine from one of the great vineyard sites for the variety in California does it justice, showing both intensity and lingering succulence. Tangerine, quince and lemon meet a more layered depth of caramelized apple and butterscotch, the texture gravelly.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Almost white in color, this is a rich wine with intense red-currant and raspberry fruits. It is a dry wine, destined to partner food, with fine acidity as well as a herbal edge. It is a concentrated wine, ready to drink from the end of 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Char and wood grain are prominent on a smoky nose with blackberry and black-currant aromas. Intense tannins and layered depth make for a full palate, while this tastes ripe and toasty, with blackberry and chocolate flavors. On the finish, mild herbal complexity mixed with latent oak are stirring. Drink through 2026.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wood-aged ros\\u00c3\\u00a9 is complex and intense. The rich fruit is only one part of the structure of the wine which is perfumed, mineral and, for a ros\\u00c3\\u00a9, dense. It is surely intended for food with its concentration and ripe aftertaste. The extra year of aging has made it ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Chardonnay's acidity and minerally structure are finely balanced, and its palate already shows richness. Full, fruity and textured, the wine's touch of toast creeps into notice. This is worth aging for 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A dense, firm selection, this has layers of red fruits and acids that help to give the wine's skeleton some flesh. This is likely to develop into a rich, but always firm, wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Terra Rossa is a bright and polished Brunello with pretty aromas of spice, anise seed, blackberry, cherry and cola. There's a note of sour cherry on the close and the wine shows bright acidity that would pair well with succulent meat and cheesy pasta dishes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a simple but genuine expression from Montalcino with bright, easy fruit tones covered by a delicate layer of spice and dried tobacco. It's not too complicated or rich, but the wine offers a fresh, easy experience nonetheless.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Gianni Brunelli's elegant Brunello opens with a bright ruby color and a lean, tonic appearance. Yet the aromas of cherry, anise seed and wild flowers are intense and beautiful. The mouthfeel is streamlined and compact.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big, age-worthy 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Tasted now, it's dryly tannic, with the black currant and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis flavors buried under a cloak of astringency. New oak, which comprises 80% of the barrels, adds even greater tannins. Give this wine at least six years, and it should continue to blossom in a good cellar for another decade.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A tremendous Cabernet, authoritative and exciting. Shows a great structure of acidity and tannins, with a cedar and sweet tobacco earthiness. Yet it's also explosive in blackberries, black cherries, red and black currants and anise liqueur. A real accomplishment, and a great compliment to the high-altitude Stagecoach Vineyard, which straddles the Atlas Peak and Napa Valley appellation lines. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The richness of this wine is immediately evident. It defines lushness, opulence, velvety ripeness, complexity, in short, Napa Bordeaux at its heady best. It's not subtle, offering waves of blackberry jam, black currant and chocolate flavors, but it's so good, you just can't keep from drinking it. And after all, that's the first duty of wine. Only 550 cases produced. Drink now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Grown on Antinori's original property, high on Atlas Peak, although you'd never know it from searching the front or back labels. It's a very fine wine, dry and elegantly constructed, with little of the baby fat over-the-topness that affects some Napa Cabs. Within that firm structure are extraordinarily complex blackberry, black currant and spicy plum flavors. Delicious now despite the firm tannins, and should develop over the next 8\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009310 years, at least.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Inspired by the Italian word for pearl, La Perlara is a delicious dessert wine that boasts a luminous golden color and intense aromas of honey, almond, apricot and sweet yellow rose. There's also a touch of piquant spice at the end that sets it apart, and the mouthfeel is indeed as smooth and silky as a pearl.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A terrific Cabernet that gives all the richness and opulence you expect in an expensive Napa Cab, yet controls it with firm tannins, acidity, minerals and earthiness. Explosive in blackberry and cherry-pie filling and chocolate granola-bar flavors that are so delicious, you can't stop reaching for another glass. The grapes come 100% from the winery's Atlas Peak appellation vineyard.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: The Vigne de l'Enfant J\\u00c3\\u00a9sus is a 10-acre parcel in the heart of the Gr\\u00c3\\u00a8ves vineyard that once belonged to Carmelite nuns. This vintage, while marked by acidity and soft fruit, does have a firm edge of dark tannins, filled out with plum and red cherry flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fruit sources for this limited-production Walla Walla bottling of Northstar Merlot include Leonetti's Loess vineyard, and Windrow and Anna Marie in the Seven Hills. Thick, lush and richly evocative, it shows Napa-like density.

White pepper notes garnish the palate, which is tense with minerality.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Violet, ripe plum, black-skinned berry, leather and truffle scents take center stage in this firmly structured red. The medium-bodied palate offers dried plum, chopped herb and licorice flavors, framed by firm, polished tannins and racy acidity, finishing on a black tea note. It's still a bit austere but should develop beautifully over the next few years. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wild berry, new leather and thyme are some of the aromas you'll discover in this savory Brunello.

There are bright gooseberry and herbal flavors that show strongly. The downside is it is one-dimensional: all herbal fruit and crisp acidity. Drink from 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a ripe and tropical wine, complex with wood aging. It is warm, intensely rich and piled with mango and pineapple flavors. The acidity and crispness are well behind this smooth, creamy wine. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With great acidity, this wine that comes from vines close to Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau Pavie, is ripe with fine tannins and a generous structure. It is fruity with red-berry fruits and a crisp texture. The wine, with its tannins, will take time to develop. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The fruit for this 100% varietal wine is sourced from Calistoga and Rutherford\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094a blend that yields a densely tannic, meaty palate that combines soy, cedar and pepper notes. Having already matured in bottle for some time, it's still slowly unfurling, offering jammy blackberry and licorice flavors that add spice to the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This includes small amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot from the famous site, the wine lushly round and decadent in a taste of chocolate sauce and plum. Dusty chalky tannin support modest acidity and powerful French oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made in an exceptionally ripe and strongly oaky way, this wine is rather heavy right now. The Cabernet was blended with some Syrah and Petit Verdot grown in a Calistoga vineyard. There's no questioning the richness, but it's so ripe that the blackberries veer into dark chocolate and prunes. See what it does over the next eight years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The California style of sweetly ripe fruit and softness is the star of this Syrah. It's fantastically rich in milk chocolate and black cherry jam flavors. The alcohol is a heady 16.6% by volume.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: At the age of more than eight years, this 100% Cabernet remains powerful with blackberry, cherry and oak flavors. It's just starting to show bottle complexity, with the tannins softening and the fruit gaining earthy tones. A criticism is the alcohol, which is high and doesn't seem to lose its heat. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This comes from the northern end of the line-up of Premier Crus, which shows in the lively, crisp and tightly fruity character of the wine. It is developing slowly, still controlled and with light hints of toast. It will be a beautiful, bright wine. Drink from 2019.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This stony, mineral wine is still way behind in its development.

It comes from the winery's vineyard in the far southern part of the valley, not far from the Carneros line.

Violets appear on the nose, softening the length of tannin and toasted oak that follow.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: If this old-school winery has a signature wine, it's Tondonia. Hailing from the hot 2003 vintage, this smells rooty, with tobacco, cedar and subtle balsamic notes that only a few wines share, for instance the occasional Barolo. High acidity is keeping this vital, while flavors of tomato, currant and raspberry come with caramel and chocolate notes. The finish, which is subtle and long, is a highlight. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A twisted, youthful nod to Sonoma County's past, this liquid tribute holds 33% Zinfandel and 33% Petite Sirah plus smaller amounts of Carignane and Alicante Bouschet.

It finishes with abrupt tannins, tons of residual flavor and weight. Drink now through 2021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Nearly seven years after harvest, it remains lively and vital. Pointed aromas of lemony oak, pencil lead and cassis are classy and a touch earthy. This is balanced in feel, but with penty of gas in the tank. Roasted, warm flavors of berry, plum, spice, herbs and pepper finish firm, with cocoa and nutmeg notes that introduce secondary tobacco and earth accents. Drink through 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The winery has been quietly building up a solid track record with this bottling, and with the 2009, they've produced their best yet. The wine is gigantic in every respect. Vast, deep flavors of roasted coffee bean, blackberry, currant, violets and dark chocolate are complex, with plenty of toasted oak in the bargain. The tannins are strong, strong, strong, numbing the palate. While nobody can assure you it has a longterm future, this should evolve nicely with time; drink through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This Sangiovese was as usual co-fermented with Syrah (13%), and sourced from a mix of estate vineyards. Smooth and supple, it's a sweetly appealing wine, loaded with strawberry preserves, but also detailed with impressive notes of Italian herbs and a whiff of tomato paste. As befits the variety, the underpinning of natural acidity lifts the finish beautifully, and suggests aging it through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Some Cabernets can get away with high alcohol, but this one one can't. It doesn't have the richness of fruit or the structure. What you get is a light blackberry-jam flavor and even a vegetable note. This is unlikely to get better with age.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine, from the producer's estate vineyard on Atlas Peak, relies on the addition of nearly 15% Petit Verdot, which provides additional prettiness and power. Well structured and in balance, it imparts cedar, dried herb and pencil shavings, as firm tannins and subtle oak play background roles. It's defined by cool-climate restraint and grace. Drink from 2022\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: On the verge of their 100th anniversary as a vintners, the Riboli family ups their luxury game with this serious and structured blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Merlot, 16% Malbec, 11% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc. Deep black cherry, licorice, dill, oregano and crushed slate show on the nose, while the savory palate combines black pepper, bitter chocolate, black plum skins, lavender and blackberry. Drink 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932033.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a bold, brawny red from a famous site, velvety in texture and all power and concentration. Forest floor and a touch of smoke complement juicy dark cherry, caramelized oak and licorice, while bright acidity supports the layers of flavor and strong tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Coming off the Rocks District, this wine displays high-toned aromas of brown stems, crushed violets and black pepper along with a light meat and olive streak. The flavors are poised and layered, showing a mixture of red and black fruits with abundant savory accents. The crazy-long finish flat out impresses.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dark blackberry, blueberry and blackcurrant fruits make for a ripe but extremely enticing nose on this bottling, lifted by aromas of vanilla, cola, clove and anise. The palate is delicious and rich with black cherry, but a zesty, bright acidity and chalky tannins contribute depth and length, with a touch of dill.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine opens with big, full-bodied and extracted flavors, highlighted by black cherry, smoked meat and clove. Blended with 4% Merlot, it exudes textural complexity and velvety lushness, with length and breadth to spare. Within its fountain of power exists a strong sense of grace, accented by aromas of wild violet and forested earth.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is actually a 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon from the producer's estate, and a selection of the winemaker's three favorite barrels of the vintage that fit best together. It is also the first release of the wine, made to honor the winery's 10th anniversary. Savory and high-toned in acidity, it masters a tartness of currant, cranberry and clove while integrating a soft, lean lushness of black cherry, the whole succulent and complex.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Viognier makes up just over 8% of this wine and it shows itself with perfumed aromas of flowers and orange peel, along with brown stems, freshly ground herb, black olive, mineral and whiffs of smoked meat. The palate is all about texture and layers, while never losing its exquisite sense of balance, gliding on the extended finish. Superb stuff, with an emphasis on elegance.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Dusty gravel and chalky rock mark the texture and nose of this 100% varietal wine, a sense of minerality that's uniquely its own. Currant, cranberry and an herbaceous streak define the midpalate, flavors that ride a lightly bodied, silky-smooth wave of nuance and elegance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The aromas start out reticent, with notes of black licorice, kirsch, black olive and earth along with some barrel notes. The flavors are bold, full and palate coating, and are capped off by a lengthy finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This estate beauty offers a depth of cola spice and lovely acidity, with just a hint of underlying richness. From a site that's slightly more coastal than the vineyards around the producer's winery, it shows savory characteristics of rhubarb and wild strawberry amid a plushness of forest, all within supportive, integrated oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Super tight, toasty berry and spice aromas are classic RDD. This is tannic as nails right now, but the future, albeit one that's down the road, is positively bright. Flavors of mocha, blackberry, espresso and toast finish hard and tannic. If ever a wine was made for long-term cellaring, this is it. Drink from 2019 through 2040.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a layered and complex estate-driven wine. Its firm, sizable tannin foundation promises longevity and enviable structure, while allowing for a plush, lush exuberance of cherry clafoutis, cardamom and salted caramel. Enjoy best 2022 through 2029.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This wine is a blend of 39% Cabernet Sauvignon, 36% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Franc. It brings heady aromas of blackberry, black cherry, earth, herb and coffee followed by dense palate-coating dark-fruit flavors. The hedonism is dialed up and the finish won't quit. The balance is absolutely impeccable. Best from 2022 to 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of espresso, sawdust, high-toned fruit and a whiff of vanilla lead the nose. On the palate, notes of chocolate and coconut accent plum, black cherry and cocoa while polished tannins offer support.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Jammy vanilla and leather mark this lean, mouth-filling wine that's had considerable time in bottle. Broad-shouldered in blackberry, it finishes with a burst of fruit and oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Toast, oak, underbrush, pressed rose and coffee aromas lead the way. The palate delivers roasted coffee beans, coconut, licorice and mint but it lacks fruit richness. Astringent tannins give a mouth-drying finish. This is already tired so drink soon.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Mostly varietal, with 6% Cabernet Franc, this wine is leathery on the palate, with flavors of black licorice, blackberry and dried herb. Well balanced, it's concentrated and juicy, and worth cellaring through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: More dry-farmed wizardry from this reliable producer, this blend of 61% Tannat, 15% Zinfandel, 14% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon shows violet, tobacco, beef char and dried purple flowers on the nose. The palate offers asphalt, rosemary-crusted lamb and complex gamy flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This bold blend of 50% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Cabernet Franc leads with aromas of ripe plums, graphite and a hint of coffee and balsamic herbs. The soft, concentrated palate delivers ripe black berries, chocolate and mocha. A licorice finish arrives alongside velvety tannins and the warmth of evident alcohol. It's delicious but fast approaching its ideal drinking window.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from organically farmed grapes, this structured wine opens with an intense fragrance of violets, iris, leather and Mediterranean herbs. The concentrated palate delivers layers of rich, wild cherry, mocha, white pepper and clove alongside bracing but fine tannins. This needs time to unwind and develop complexity. Drink 2015\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 44% Cabernet Franc, 43% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Petit Verdot, the curious name refers to Saint-\\u00c3\\u0089milion, in Bordeaux. The wine is instantly likeable for the sheer richness of its cherry and mocha flavors. The tannins are pretty hard, suggesting a wine that will age until 2020, but you can certainly drink it now, especially with grilled steak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A gold-colored wine, intensely sweet and with intense acidity. The combination gives a wine that is lemon and honey in a glass. There is a liquorous feel to the smooth texture. And it is still very young. Drink after 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The producer has a lonely half-acre of this variety, unusual to California, on its estate. This bottling is 100% varietal, providing a tangy taste experience of subdued red fruit and low tannin and oak. Like many hearty, full-bodied reds, it could use food to balance out its concentration and weight.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A marriage of zippy acidity and ripe raspberry and cherry fruit, this Pinot is a bit simple, sweet and candied. Yet there are considerable tannins lurking in the background, and the wine could develop bottle interest over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich, ripe and extracted with cherry and currant fruit, this Cab Franc shows fine tannins, acids and a dry finish that makes it drinkable now. It has a Napa fanciness that lifts it into elegance.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a stylish, flashy Napa red that's ready to drink now, even without decanting. It's rich and layered with blackberries, cherries and cassis, folded into sweet, soft, complex tannins. It's a Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux blend with 14% Sangiovese, which seems to add acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The wine feels very dense, juicy, dark and concentrated. It has a huge feel to it, a powerful wine that will need several years to fully soften and round it. And, At 15.5% alcohol, this is way too heavy for a Bordeaux.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The second wine of Ch\\u00c3\\u00a2teau Chauvin is a structured, perfumed wine with its high proportion of Cabernet Franc giving much of its potential richness and spice. The tannins are solid and will always show well as an integral part of this complex wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Big and brawny, this is dry and hard in tannins, as Nickel & Nickel wines tend to be in youth. This one, from a cool section of southern Napa Valley, is brisk in acids, making it rather closed now. But it has a gigantic core of blackberries, with a delicious edge of dark chocolate. Merlot is a difficult wine to age in California, but this one should improve over the next five years, maybe longer.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Gaja's latest Barbaresco shows deep aromatic layers of ripe fruit, leather, black licorice, dried herb and savory tobacco. It is extremely velvety and smooth, with firm tannins and a richly extracted fruit finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the superelegant Cannubi Cru, this wine shows amazing finesse and texture.

It's simple, genuine and sophisticated all at once.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: An impressive blend from some of the top vineyards in Sancerre, this is a rounded, smooth, almost toasty wine. It has flavors of spice as well as green and citrus fruits. Full in the mouth and intense, age this for at least two years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is gorgeous with a delicate but intense bouquet of pressed rose, wet earth, licorice cola and dried berry fruit. The mouthfeel is incredibly long and silky.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is marked by intense flavors of blackberry, cherry and currant, with sweet smoky oak, firm, furry tannins and brisk acidity. All of these elements jostle for position, making the wine currently aggressive and unresolved. However, the suggestion of ageability is warranted. Put it to sleep in your cellar for six years and see how it's doing. It could be fine in 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The softness of the 2007 vintage is already apparent in this wine. Generous aromas of ripe fruit, black cherry, leather and tobacco follow suit, and the wine is plush and velvety on the close. Hold for 10\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009315 more years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Oak dominates this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and butterscotch notes offering an immediate impact. Underneath the oak tones are very rich, opulent flavors of pineapple and orange jam and lime tart. It's a bit jumbled now, but this may be a Chardonnay that can take some cellaring.

It will need another year or two to show its best, so drink from 2019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a lovely, funky and earthy blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Sangiovese. Light bodied in style, it imparts touches of mushroom, bouillon and leather around its core of black fruit, remaining savory in personality throughout.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Alidis is not the most consistent winery in Ribera del Duero, but this gran reserva gets it mostly right. Earthy, slightly mulchy and rubbery berry aromas lead to a saturated bulky palate. Saucy earthy flavors of black fruits finish gritty and a bit leathery, with a jammy weight and a lasting note of black coffee.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tannic and robust, this reserve-tier wine offers smoothly chiseled tannin and full-bodied flavors like brick, black cherry, leather and clove. It begs to be paired with hearty meat dishes.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine has a classic personality: round and soft in tannin, with a chalkiness lurking behind herbal tobacco leaf, tomato, cedar and rose notes. Full-bodied, it doesn't hold back on ripeness but displays more savory character than fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A firm wine from a cool vineyard. It is structured, dry and solid, the fruit dominated by tannins. There is an austere character here that obviously needs time to fill out. Give it five years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A solid wine, finely constructed, its chunky tannins blending well with the red-plum-juice flavors. The acidity is important, along with the tasty cherry texture. Age for 3\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00934 years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: For a Grand Cru from Vosne-Roman\\u00c3\\u00a9e, this is a wine on the light side, its tannins soft and dominated by new-wood flavors. That said, it is still a fine wine, packed with ripe fruit and fresh acidity. The structure floats over the fruit; a few months and it may fatten out.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Beautifully composed, with power and just as much precision and pizzazz. The nose offers lightly baked berry fruit notes, leather and spice, while the palate is loaded with tobacco, exotic spices and the finest natural berry flavors Spain has to offer.

Drink from 2012 through 2018.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Talk about magnetic aromas of bacon, tobacco and bold black fruit, and then comes an oak-rich palate full of coconut, butter, chocolate and exotic berry flavor. Chocolate truffle and pastry work the finish, and overall this is a mile-deep beauty to drink from 2011 through 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is Ferrari-Carano's most upscale wine, a blend comprised of all five of the famous Bordeaux varieties. It's as lush and intricate as almost anything out of Napa, with sumptuous blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. The giveaway that it's Sonoma comes in the herbaceousness and slightly greener tannins. Now\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A brilliant dessert wine. It costs a lot of money to pick a wine like this, which is carefully selected on an almost cluster-by-cluster basis, but the results speak for themselves.

Utterly delicious.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A beautifully ripe wine, layering all the dense botrytis of the vintage with freshest acidity. It has weight, the texture of grainy honey, ripe yellow fruits, mango and orange zest. Impressive and certainly for aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Make room in the cellar for this heavyweight! Talk about a monster wine; but there's also finesse, character and style to it. Alabaster is the top wine from the Eguren family's new Toro winery, and it's big, tannic and loaded with spice, molasses and syrupy black fruit flavors. Rich, long and fierce on the finish, with tannins and heat to resolve. Best from 2012 through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Light and spicy, this deceptively robust, ripe cherry-cola wine lingers in acidity and a roundness of tannin that makes it both lush and plush, yet balanced. The oak is supportive without being intrusive.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, grilled porcini, roasted herb and menthol emerge in the glass. The medium-bodied, structured palate is initially closed but eventually reveals dark berry, white pepper, sage and orange zest alongside clenched tannins.

The old vines give depth to the rich wine that finishes with layers of bright fruit. Drink from 2018.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: While it is not a premier cru, this wine conveys many of the precise red-fruit flavors of the Les Marconnets vineyard just below on the slope. It is finely perfumed, with the softness typical of the northern Beaune vineyards. Vivid strawberry and red-cherry fruits are already delicious and ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is no basic white Burgundy. With balanced wood aging and ripe fruit, it is rich and full in the mouth. It has tense acidity as well as an almost honeyed character. The wood fits well into this wine along with final acidity. It is ready to drink.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Soft and gentle in handfuls of rose petal and cardamom, this wine veers more savory than fruity, offering definite appeal to fans of a full-bodied yet more complex style. That exotic spiciness persists to the finish that adds length and breadth to the acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Already the structure is beginning to make way for ripe plum and damson fruits. With its firm structure, this is a complex and concentrated wine that will need to age over at least four years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with simple fruit tones of cherry and cassis backed by evolved aromas of spice, leather and cola. It shows impressive purity and a long, silky finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a crisp expression of Nebbiolo that is finessed and elegant. It opens with dusty aromas of dried currant, crushed stone and black pepper. The tannins are solid and polished; it needs at least 10 more years of cellar aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Dominated by Merlot at 90%, this is a smooth, rich and generous wine. It does have a tannic core, but that is surrounded by these velvet, ripe berry fruits and opulent texture. The wine is developing well and should be drunk from 2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: There is as much fruit as structure in this wine. Ripe red fruits are supported by solid tannins while pushing out fragrant acidity. It has structure while also allowing room for final fruitiness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very big and smoky, an impressive young Merlot that grabs you by the collar and shakes you.

It feels vibrant and fresh in the mouth with well- integrated acidity against firm tannins. Pair this pretty wine with grilled meats.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: What a difference a year can make. Last year's Brunello was ripe and awkward, but this pretty 2004 vintage hits all the right notes. The wine is firm, tonic and buoyant and those impressions are sustained thanks to uplifting aromas of wild berry, cherry cola and spice.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This seductive Brunello portrays aromas of black fruit, vanilla, brown sugar, plums and prunes wrapped within a thin veil of smoke. It's a wine that reaches a comfortable level of intensity and balance and that offers mouth-puckering flavors of sour cherry on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here is a light and feminine expression of Brunello that delivers bright berry and white cherry with pretty layers of dried mint and cherry cola at the back.

The flavors are intricate, offering tiers of blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha and toasty oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is a hearty and masculine Brunello that is redolent of espresso syrup, cherry liqueur, rum cake and moist pipe tobacco.

Fresh and fruity, it's ready to drink, with a light mineral texture already well integrated.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of red berry, tobacco, coconut and espresso meld together with a balsamic note.

Big bodied, it finishes in a puckering way, hefty on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Charred earth, underbrush, cured meat and toasted hazelnut aromas lift out of the glass.

The robust, extremely ripe palate doles out stewed prune, blackberry jam and licorice while firm, close-grained tannins provide support.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Charred earth, leafy underbrush, prune marinated in spirits and grilled herbs come together in the glass. The warm, evolved palate shows blackberry jam, dried cherry, licorice and the heat of evident alcohol alongside bracing tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to soften then drink sooner rather than later to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Aromas that recall sugared plum, espresso, toast and underbrush lead the way on this robust wine.

It's extremely ripe and you'll also detect the warmth of alcohol on close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of mature dark-skinned fruit, espresso, baked plum and grilled porcini lead the nose. The tight, taut palate delivers fleshy Morello cherry, blackberry clove and licorice while close-grained tannins leave an assertive, tongue drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lots to like about this wine, from the Sonoma side of Spring Mountain. Shows firm, fine tannins and well-developed blackberry and cherry flavors. But there's a disturbingly hot, sweet quality, the result of excessive alcohol, and also a sweaty, animal taste that possibly comes from brettanomyces spoilage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Executed by vintner Claudia Ferrero, this remarkable Brunello Riserva shows enormous intensity and staying power. The wine's genuine aromas include wet earth, dried forest berry, leather, pipe tobacco and smoked bacon. The mouthfeel is rich and determined with polished tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very deeply flavored, with fine, ripe blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors, anchored with an earthy minerality. The finish is thoroughly dry. Yet it's also a very tannic wine, with a bracing, but fierce, mouthfeel that suggests time in the cellar. Better after 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bone dry, toasty, forward, and tart. The flavors orient themselves around a bright core of blueberry fruit. The Sangiovese grape's natural acidity gives structure and support; the fruit and oak are perfectly balanced. A strong streak of licorice and smoke weaves through the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a thick and opulent Brunello Riserva with a pleasurable and forward style that puts emphasis on intensity, quality of fruit and texture. The wine boasts a dark garnet color with aromas that span from exotic spice to pressed flowers. It needs at least five more years of cellar aging because the tannins are still a bit young.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This brawny wine leads with aromas of blue flower, red berry, spice and a whiff of wet soil. The palate offers succulent wild cherry layered with notes of sweet vanilla, mint, espresso and thyme alongside rather angular tannins and evident alcohol.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Subdued aromas of wild red berry, sunbaked earth and dark baking spice emerge in the glass.

Drink soon to capture what fruit remains.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's a dullness to the nose of this wine, followed up by punches of dark plum, chocolate and chalky tannin. Reserved on the midpalate, it finds a burst of chocolate to share at the end.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This late harvest dessert wine from Sardinia is made with native grape Nasco and a small amount of Malvasia di Cagliari.

Velvety smooth yet fresh, it makes a perfect after dinner drink, or pair it with aged cheeses or fruit tarts.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Reduced initially, this wine shows a feral herbal side, a sign of its cool-climate sourcing, which provides a funky personality. Mushroom, clove and a thickness of earth all make a play to be center of attention.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This opens with subdued aromas of French wood, grilled herb, forest floor and dark spice. The firmly structured palate shows espresso, toast, powdered sage and licorice but not much fruit richness. Grainy drying tannins leave an astringent mouthfeel.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Underbrush, coconut, espresso and floral aromas lead the nose. It's full-bodied but lean in terms of fruit richness, offering exotic spice, roasted coffee bean and a hint of licorice while aggressive grainy tannins leave a mouth-drying astringent finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Massive, dramatic, beautiful, intense, but young and firm in tannins, with a cut of fresh acidity. Shows concentrated blackberries, black currants, violets, minerals and cedar, leading to a long, penetrating finish. Very great Cabernet, vibrant and potent, just tremendous in structure. Potentially a near-perfect wine with 4\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00936 years in the bottle.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Concentrated to the hilt, with molten black fruit, coconut and mint aromas. The palate is driven, tannic, pure and features dynamite flavors of black fruit, bitter chocolate and spice cake. So beautiful and big, but also showing elegance and restraint. Drinkable now but will age well for another seven years or more.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Ripe plum, fragrant blue flower, Mediterranean herb, espresso and a whiff of exotic spice are some of the aromas you'll find on this structured, polished red. It's still young and tightly wound, offering mature black cherry, raspberry compote, licorice, toast and ground pepper flavors that are framed by youthfully assertive yet refined tannins. Give it a few more years to soften and fully develop; drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932028.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Scorched earth, underbrush, cured meat and grilled sage aromas lead the way together with a whiff of new leather. The ripe, juicy palate doles out black raspberry, succulent wild cherry, baking spice and a hint of tobacco. Packed but mature tannins retrain the rich fruit.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Lush and juicy, this has a grippy firmness of structure and the accompanying suggestion of years to go. Cassis and cedar lead over notes of black cherry and berry, with the support of a full, concentrated body. Drink now through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lightly tropical and entirely mineral-driven, racing in acidity, this tightly wound wine is cradled in toasty, integrated oak that's still trying to let go. It shows hints of the goodness within, from crisp green apple to caramel and lemon meringue. Drink now through 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Poggio Antico is one of the best estates in Montalcino but the 2008 vintage doesn't reach the impressive heights of 2006 or 2007 that showed much fuller and more generous results. This edition offers plum, wild berry and leather aromas with a lean mouthfeel and sharp acidity that will soften with a few more years of bottle aging.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This austere Brunello opens with dusty, mineral notes of crushed white peppercorn and brimstone followed by cherry candy, licorice, cola and dried garden herb. The wine shows an interesting and complex bouquet that holds its own in terms of intensity. There isn't much fresh fruit, but the tannins are dusty and fine.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Here's a riserva Brunello that opens with inky, dark concentration and tertiary aromas of graham cracker, dried carob powder and ripe berry fruit. The wine shows a dusty, powdery side that makes it appear older than it really is. Black currant, cured meat and leather appear on the close. Drink now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sometimes Sangiovese Grosso, depending on the vineyard and the vintage, shows slightly green aromas of dried Mediterranean herbs like bay leaf and rosemary. This Brunello offers a glimpse of that with loads of bright cherry, blackberry and leather at the back. The close is bright and fresh.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Le Chiuse delivers a consistent message with its wines year after year. It strives for clean, austere and territory-driven expressions of Sangiovese Grosso. This vintage is very true to the estate philosophy: You'll recognize wild berry, white cherry, rose petal, dried ginger and cola. You can count on it evolving nicely over the years.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Prune and lead pencil are the key aromas, and there's raisin in the background. The palate offers a mix of lushness and pulsing acid shocks, while the flavors are dark, sweet and pruney. Short on the finish and overall it's more dark and sultry than your average Graciano.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A Bordeaux-inspired blend of 54% Cabernet Franc, 28% Merlot and 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a tightly woven wine with buoyant minerality and a baseline of complexity, dry and balanced in cranberry, graphite, herb and tobacco leaf. It is composed and layered, enjoyable now and over time, through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Concentrated, inky and charred on the nose, this is a ripe and heady Rioja with strong barrel influences. Blackberry, cassis and roasted black-plum flavors are appropriate given the wine's hefty build. Finishing flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and baking spices are long and thorough. Drink this powerful Tempranillo-led blend through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This cellar-worthy treasure has attention-grabbing spice, leather and smoky oak aromas. Ripe fruit flavors are heavily shaded with undeniably delicious accents of cedar and chocolate. It is bold in flavor, full in body and quite tannic in texture. Hold until at least 2018; the wine should improve even more after that.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The fifth vintage from this cool site near Annapolis, the wine is spicy, creamy and on the fuller-bodied end of the spectrum, aromatically rich in baked strawberry and raspberry. Resolved tannins and integrated oak make for a seamless experience, the wine clean, composed and crisp on the finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Cabernet Franc, this full-bodied wine opens with aromas of mature red berry, exotic spice and a whiff of purple flowers. The elegantly structured palate doles out juicy red currants, crushed raspberries, clove, cinnamon and licorice alongside firm, silky tannins. A tobacco note signals the close. Drink through 2021.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fragrant, fresh and loaded with finesse, this blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot opens with scents of fragrant blue flowers, perfumed berry and a whiff of pine forest. The bright, silky palate delivers crunchy red currants, juicy raspberries and white pepper. It's nicely balanced, with firm, polished tannins and lively acidity. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of ripe blue- and black-skinned fruit, dried herb and cedar lead the nose on this savory blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot. The firmly structured palate doles out spiced blueberries, blackberries, mint and black pepper alongside chewy tannins. A licorice note signals the close. Drink through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This hearty blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cabernet Franc and 9% Merlot is what put Justin on the map, and it still impresses with its elegantly woven tobacco, leather, cocoa, blueberry, and caramel aromas. It hits the palate softly, showing black cherry, baking spice, milk chocolate and faint mint notes, ending in a finish that reveals a firm tannic structure.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Lifted heady notes of Damask rose rise from the glass alongside lemony tang. The palate brims with the same rose petal notes but also holds plenty of spice: sandalwood and ginger, white pepper and the merest touch of vanilla. The palate is concentrated and rounded with gentle sweetness, countered by fresh lemon acidity. The persistence of flavors on the palate is incredible. Serve this either with fruity spicy Asian fare or runny, soft and very ripe cheeses.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The unmistakable yet subtle notes of rose water appear as though they were drizzled over ripe juicy peach flesh. The palate boosts these generous fruit flavors with soft and measured residual sweetness. The medium-dry body is gentle, supple, fluid and generous but punctuated with sprightly, aromatic citrus to strike a harmonious balance. The finish is subtle, clean and perfumed with rose petals. Drink now through 2030.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is most restrained: the slightest notions of jasmine and nettle appear. With more air, a faint hint of orange peel emerges. The palate is one of streamlined slenderness and precision. This is like a dry laser beam festooned with honeysuckle blossom and fresh lemon zest. There is something that draws you ever deeper into stone and citrus. The lightness of the dry palate remains simply astonishing.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Sourced from the estate's Paderewski and Catapult vineyards, this blend of 32% Syrah, 25% Grenache, 25% Mourv\\u00c3\\u00a8dre, 10% Tempranillo and 8% Zinfandel bursts with blackberry, baking spice, violet and Concord grape aromas. Framed by firm but ready tannins, the palate shows blackberry, cola, white pepper and dried lavender flavors.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Wild berry, forest floor, chopped herb and a balsamic note are some of the aromas you'll find in this bright, elegant red. The vibrant, medium-bodied palate offers crushed raspberry, red cherry and baking spice flavors, buttressed by taut, polished tannins and fresh acidity. A blast of orange zest further lifts the finish. Drink 2019\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932027.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This is a big wine in its breadth of flavors and structure. Powerful tannins give hints of the wood aging. The ripe black fruit is given a crisp edge by the acidity that is typical of the vintage. The wine will certainly age well. Drink from 2023.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the major estates in Pessac-L\\u00c3\\u00a9ognan, this is a fine, stylish and tightly structured wine. It has spice and intense acidity to balance the dark tannins and black-currant fruit. It is going to need several years to really mature. The estate is owned by Andr\\u00c3\\u00a9 Lurton who was influential in creating the Pessac-L\\u00c3\\u00a9ognan appellation. Drink from 2024.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This rich wine has a good proportion (31%) of Cabernet Franc to give it a perfumed structured character. It is dense and with considerable tannins at this stage. By contrast, the fruit has enormous potential with rich blackberry and black-plum flavors. This chateau has made a considerable stride in this vintage. Drink from 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The nose is reminiscent of the yellow and aromatic peel of ripe apples. It even has a touch of mirabelle. The palate continues in the same fruit-driven vein with that pure, ripe but tart apple note that seems to be such a feature of Alsace Riesling. The palate is dry and has a fine-boned structure that almost crunches in the mouth. A pure lemon note makes for a very clean-cut finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Tight and concentrated, this is a very fine wine. Great acidity and great tannins go with the most intense fruit. Blackberry and black-cherry flavors power through this structured wine. There is also elegance and a fine sense of style. Drink from 2025.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely from Sangiovese, this opens with intense violet, red berry, Mediterranean herb and tilled soil aromas. The palate is polished and layered in crushed raspberry, juicy black cherry, pipe tobacco, mint and white pepper flavors. Velvety tannins provide structure. Enjoy through 2022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is another stunner from Pellet Estate, from a high-elevation vineyard within the proposed Petaluma Gap appellation, which is highly influenced by fog and wind. Wet stone notes and a crisp, lemony acidity suggest freshness, neither detracting from body or texture.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A perfumed, finely structured wine, with firm, dusty tannins. The wood is well-balanced with acidity and some generous weight, finishing with black fruits and intense freshness.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Already the velvet texture is broadening out to give a wine that shows solid fruits, bright and sweet, never heavy, but with plenty of ripeness and polish. Inside this suave character, there is a core of tight tannins, promising medium-term aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A wine that is dominated by wood at this stage in its development. But the structure and the fruit are all there, waiting to slot into place in the next 2\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00933 years. Spice and bright black berry flavors layer with final acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Very rich and classically structured, a wine that shows real Merlot personality. The red cherry, cola, red licorice, sandalwood and peppery spice flavors are almost Pinot Noir-like, except for the tannins, which have the weight of Bordeaux. Should develop through 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made almost exclusively from Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a deeply colored, ripely rich young wine that shows masses of blackberries. There are supporting notes of pain grill\\u00c3\\u00a9, anise, violets, anise and smoky oak, with a firm grounding of minerals. Shows some tartness and astringency that strongly suggest time in the cellar. Try beyond 2012.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The most successful of Amphora's new Pinots because of its richness and balance. Shows strong, forward flavors of berries, cherries and cola, liberally accented with sandalwood, and brightened with acidity. Yet there are elusive tugs of earthier, mushroomy notes. Delicious now, and probably at its best through 2011.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Truffle, underbrush, mature plum, saddle leather and a balsamic note emerge on this robust red. The hearty, one-dimensional palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice and grilled herb alongside solid if not very persistent tannins. You'll also notice the heat of alcohol on the rather quick, drying finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of stewed plum, leather, truffle and dark spice lead the nose. The full-bodied palate offers dried cherry, orange zest and a hint of licorice alongside assertive tannins that leave a firm finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unwind a little then drink to capture the remaining fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a sassy and bright Brunello that shows a lean consistency and sharp aromas of white cherry, cassis, ginger and cola. The wine's natural acidity makes for a nervous and edgy personality overall.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Vintage after vintage, the wines of Camigliano offer a long perspective on the changing evolution and complexities of Brunello di Montalcino. This edition shows bright berry nuances with spicy highlights of white pepper and cola. The mouthfeel is crisp and sharp.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A steady protagonist in the greater Brunello family, PianCornello delivers a masculine and powerful wine with aromas of dark fruit, leather, tobacco and rum cake. It shows medium density and thickness in the mouth, with bright cherry flavors shining through on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From one of the oldest estates in Montalcino, this pretty Brunello opens with inky dark fruit and plump cherry backed by touches of leather and spice. But like many of the wines from the 2008 vintage, it shows austere and sharp acidity as well.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An inky dark color sets the stage for this thickly extracted Brunello. Oak-inspired shadings of clove, nutmeg and toast appear at first and are slowly followed by dark cherry, blackberry and currant. Despite all that color and aromatic intensity, the wine seems quite tame and lean in the mouth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of wood shop, coffee and espresso all carry over to the palate along with oak extract and toast. It lacks the fruit richness necessary to stand up to the oak.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Chappellet winemaker Phillip Corallo-Titus helps make this wine, a blend of 79% Cabernet Sauvignon with 11% Petit Verdot, 5% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec. While possessing a sizable tannin structure it remains balanced and elegant in cedar, pencil shavings, tart cranberry and cassis. It's rich and velvety.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made with equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red berry, mint and a whiff of kitchen spice. The forward palate delivers black currant, graphite, licorice and tobacco alongside firm, polished tannins. Best 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932019.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This structured wine opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, toasted oak, roasted coffee beans and a whiff of raisin. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha, espresso and vanilla alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, with small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec, this is a big, juicy wine with high acidity and a taste of crisp, red fruit. Substantial tannins suggest cellaring through 2018\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932020 to elongate the young, puckering finish.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Bertani keeps a library of vintages that remain available. This 2000 is absolutely gorgeous, with exotic spice, clove, milled pepper, black fruit, dried apple skin, tobacco and cola. The complexity is extraordinary and so is the smoothness and quality of its fine tannins. Hold this wine another 10 years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a surprise from Mt. Etna that blew us away. Made by Pietro Caciorgna, this is a delicate and linear wine with pristine aromas of blue flower, delicate forest fruit and black stone. It represents the best of elegant winemaking with that unmistakable blast of volcanic power at the rear.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Don Peppino's vineyard lies on the lower slopes of Mt. Etna where the black volcanic terrain is easier to cultivate. The resulting fruit here comes across as focused and well-defined by mineral and berry tendencies with excellent crispness and enormous endurance on the close.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Fresh, fruity and acidic, this young Pinot Noir wants some time in the cellar. It's brilliantly structured, with a core of black cherries, cola, rhubarbs, pomegranates, mushrooms and spices, with rich notes of smoke, cocoa and cedar. Silky and complex, and should age through 2013.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Run by four boisterous brothers, Tenuta Sant'Antonio is among the rising stars of Valpolicella. This 2004 Amarone delivers thick concentration and intense aromas of dried fruit and black licorice followed by big power and heat. The wine tastes smooth and exceptionally rich in the mouth. It's absolutely gorgeous.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Bosan is a sweet-smelling Amarone with vibrant aromas of blueberry and cherry followed by delicate floral nuances. The wine is direct and immediate with background aromas of red apple, vanilla and oak. It's exceedingly smooth and ends with sweet fruit and soft tannins. An outstanding wine.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A beautiful Cabernet for drinking now, this has softly luscious tannins framing flavors of ripe, elegant blackberry, cherry jam and mocha. There's an enticing herbal richness and the finish is sweetly oaky.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: After an early blast of gaseous sulfur, this heavyweight Tempranillo smells of toasted oak, graphite, latex and alcohol. The palate is lush, meaty, jammy and borderline syrupy, while flavors of blackberry, fig and chocolate finish with depth and extreme richness. Drink through 2025.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A blend of almost equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this estate-grown wine is sanguine in smoky leather and tobacco. Rich, with a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg, it has a lengthy finish that is balanced and elegant on the palate.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of fruit from Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Leonetti Old Block, this standout wine opens with alluring aromas of dark chocolate, raspberries, blueberries, sandalwood and assorted spices. The palate is plush and fruit-filled but with well-balanced acidity and impressive length.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Red berry, baking spice, mint, leather and rose petal aromas emerge on this beautiful, balanced Barolo. It shows remarkable freshness for the vintage, offering juicy wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and a balsamic note alongside polished tannins and bright acidity.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: With an exotic, tropical edge, this wine takes time to develop, like a flower closed up overnight. Medium in body and length, it teases in honeysuckle, white peach and fresh pineapple, before delivering a tartness of lemon zest and well-defined minerality on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This concentrated Sangiovese opens with aromas of underbrush, toasted oak, vanilla, mature plum and ripe berry. The firm palate offers fleshy blackberry extract, clove, licorice and oak-driven spice alongside a backbone of bracing tannins. Drink 2017\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932022.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: The inaugural vintage from the owners of Atlas Vineyard Management in Napa, which also farms vineyards in Oregon and California's Central Coast, this is exquisite in candied popcorn aromas, with a seasoning of fennel. Soft and juicy, it remains fresh on the palate, finishing crisp and clean.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Aromas of spiced blueberry, blue flowers, cedar, tobacco and grilled herbs come together on this blend of 50% Merlot, 40% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Cabernet Franc. The palate delivers juicy blackberry, mature plum, white pepper, clove and grilled rosemary. It's young but well balanced, with velvety tannins. Drink 2016\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00932021.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: This wine backs up the price tag with a fruit-forward nose showing blackberry, black cherry, dried mint and tarragon. The palate is more tart, with dried sour cherries, espresso-bean bitterness, lava rocks and graphite. It's surprisingly both dark and lean, offering solid complexity.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: With 15.4% alcohol by volume, this is arguably Lail's ripest, hottest Cabernet ever. It certainly has flashy blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with plenty of toasty oak, but there's a raisin-and-prune, overripe finish. Could age, but it's more likely that the heat will pinch in within six years, crushing the fruit.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A meaty Shiraz that pulls no punches, proudly displaying its black raspberry and earthy, salumi-infused flavors around a rich, dense texture full of leather and a touch of smoke. The Temecula Valley is continuing to make strides and this is a jumbo-jet-sized example that finishes a teensy bit sweet. The Shiraz is blended with 11% Cinsault.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: More than in the past, this vintage of Christina is showing a ton of oak up front along with vanilla, plastic and hickory aromas. Round, staunch and tannic on the palate, this single-vineyard Tinto Fino tastes toasted, blackened and minty, with blackberry, peppercorn and licorice flavors; hold until 2017.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A seamless commingling of cardamom and allspice around bursts of black cherry, this is a soft, dark and brooding wine, with an earthy soul and a spicy finish. Still young, it should take on further nuance over time, but is good to go right now.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Joined by 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this stellar wine from an almost 50-50 Napa-Sonoma divide delivers big flavor and tannin and yet exudes vibrant juicy plum and blueberry, keeping it grounded and alive. Silky through and through, it's complex in dark chocolate and a touch of dried herbs.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the family's Roberts Road Vineyard below Gap's Crown, this earthy, foresty, plummy and gamy wine offers a luscious mouthfeel and silky tannins. Structured, it's built for pairing. A tangy red cherry and citrus twist on the palate provides a refreshing sensibility, before ending bright and light.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Velvety smooth, this estate-driven wine is soft, with a backbone of integrated oak, seasoned in pleasing handfuls of clove and black cherry. Juicy on the palate, and well structured, it finishes brisk in acidity and a note of mocha.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Elegant in fine-grained tannins, this well-made, complex wine offers savory cranberry and cassis plus brighter, spicier red fruit, alongside a layering of graphite, dried herb and chocolate. Full bodied, it remains balanced throughout, finishing with length and breadth.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: From the Pritchard Hill section of the vineyard, this wine consists of 75% Syrah and 25% Grenache. A hearty, fruity and big-boned explosion of blueberry and strawberry, it's rimmed in coconut flake and black, leathery pepper. Dense and full bodied, the minerality should allow it to cellar and integrate through 2020.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend based on Nerello Mascalese, with a tiny percentage of Nerello Cappuccio, this boasts a bold, compelling bouquet of wild berry, leather, tobacco and a light shading of crushed spice. The mouthfeel is characterized by elegance, power and determination.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Abundantly rich in fruit, this Cabernet shows its California origins in the incredibly ripe blackberry, cherry and chocolate flavors. It's sweet, almost like pie filling, except the finish is thoroughly dry. Thick mountain tannins make for astringency, suggesting ageworthiness. The window of drinkability looks like 2014-2016.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: A pinch of hard tannins gives this bone-dry young wine an astringent toughness. It shows very fine, concentrated black-cherry, cocoa and cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me de cassis flavors. Aging in almost 100% new French oak adds notes of toast that the fruit easily tolerates. Nearly all Merlot, it's a wine of considerable volume, but nowhere near ready to drink. Give it at least six years in a proper cellar, and it could be one of the rare Merlot-based California wines capable of extended aging.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Few Bordeaux-style wines in California are as ripe and bold as this, but that's the Pride style. The wine explodes in spicy blackberry, currant and cherry fruit, almost like punch, while oak adds toasty notes. A heady wine, it's also brutally firm in tannins. It's a little warm in alcohol, but that shouldn't keep it from aging for at least eight years\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and maybe longer.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: California Malbec by itself tends to be straightforward, which might be why the winemaker blended this one with a bit of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The result is excellent, one of the best Malbecs in California, with rich blackberry, currant and cedar flavors. The strong tannins suggest it should pair well with beef.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Made entirely with Pinot Nero, this stunning wine offers aromas of rose, small red berry and pastry. The silky palate offers strawberry, baked apple, nectarine zest, bread crust and nut alongside an elegant, persistent perlage.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Plump black currants, fragrant purple lilacs and a tiny bit of roasted beef show on the nose of this blend of 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot, 16% Malbec, 16% Petit Verdot and 10% Cabernet Franc. The palate is less showy, with firm tannins, energizing acidity and a mineral-driven center line, offering cooked purple fruit on the finish.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Deep, heady aromas of black cherry, gingersnap cookies and black loam show on the nose. Rich and penetrating flavors of blackberry and brown spice are cut with a ripe fruit freshness in this heavy-duty wine with lots of life.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: A blend of 95% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Petit Verdot, this soft, approachable wine from a storied producer is meant to enjoy young and yet exudes plenty of complexity. Luscious aromas of graham cracker and blueberry jam belie a classically balanced measure of integrated tannins and dark chocolate. Drink now through 2020.\", \"return: 0<br>tasting_note: Made from organically farmed fruit, this wine has distinctive aromas of wild fennel and rosemary, backed by touches of forest berry, cured meat and bresaola. Firm but silky tannins are followed by smoked bacon and leather notes.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: There's grip around this wine's core of clove, plum and smoke but the lushness is muted, perhaps an indication of the tough growing year, while structure remains. Small amounts of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc are blended in, the whole aged in 51% new French oak.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This hot and heavy wine by Michael Gill is probably passing its peak right now, but it currently offers tobacco, stewed prunes and balsamic-glazed beef aromas. The flavors are a bit oxidized, which gives a nutty milk chocolate and brownie flavor, but the acidity and tannins are falling out. Drink now or the score drops dramatically.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Laser-focused acidity adds polish to luscious sweet pear and tangerine flavors in this decadently sweet bottling. Delicately lacy in mouthfeel, it finishes with a savory dusting of pollen and crushed stones.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Rich doesn't begin to describe this Chard. It's humongous in pie-filling and grilled peaches, pears, pineapples and papayas, while 50% new oak adds all sorts of buttercream, cr\\u00c3\\u00a8me br\\u00c3\\u00bbl\\u00c3\\u00a9e and smoked butter layers. Yet the wine shows a minerality that grounds and balances it. Very fancy stuff, and should age for up to six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Here's a beautifully structured young Cabernet, blended with a little Merlot, that has turned soft and generous enough after five years to drink now. Yet it shows a complex depth that will enable it to age for a few more years. It is, in a word, delicious, with black currant, black cherry pie, orange zest, cocoa and spicy, smoky oak nuances.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: Shows all the hallmarks of a wine that will improve with mid-term aging. The flavors leap out now, and are all about ripe, crushed blackberries, red and black currants, anise and sweet, smoky cedar. Yet there's a tannic interference that's a little hard and astringent. Decant, if you have to open, but should hit its stride after 2009.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: An intriguing Pinot Noir that shows the possibilities of this cool-climate, southwestern Sonoma region. The wine has been well-oaked, but it's powerful enough to carry that coating of caramel and char, with a massive palate explosion of pur\\u00c3\\u00a9ed ripe cherries, red currants and sweet rhubarb pie. Delicious now with decanting, and should do interesting things over the next six years.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate. Shows lush cherries and cassis, with rich nuances of vanilla, smoky wood and anise. Decadent and delicious, and best now through 2011. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, but comprised of all 5 Bordeaux varieties.\", \"return: 1<br>tasting_note: This is Corley's first Pinot Noir since 1999 and it's delicious. Grown in the cooler Oak Knoll District, it shows Pinot's opulent side, with a silky, velvety texture framing ripe cherry pie, red currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors.
